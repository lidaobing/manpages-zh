.SH "描述 DESCRIPTION"
.SS ckalloc
.PP
This macro allocates memory, in the same manner as \fBmalloc\fR, with the
following differences: One, \fBckalloc\fR checks the value returned from
\fBmalloc\fR (it calls \fBmalloc\fR for you) and panics if the allocation
request fails.  Two, if enabled at compile time, a version of \fBckalloc\fR
with special memory debugging capabilities replaces the normal version of
\fBckalloc\fR, which aids in detecting memory overwrites and leaks (repeated
allocations not matched by corresponding frees).
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIsize\fR - The size of the memory block to be allocated.
.RE
.PP
Returns:
.RS 2
A pointer to the allocated memory block.
.RE
'
.SS ckfree
.PP
This macro frees memory allocated by \fBckalloc\fR.  Like \fBckalloc\fR,
when memory debugging is enabled, \fBckfree\fR has enhanced capabilities
for detecting memory overwrites and leaks.
.PP
It is very important that you use \fBckalloc\fR when you need to allocate
memory, and that you use \fBckfree\fR to free it.  Should you use \fBmalloc\fR
to allocate and \fBckfree\fR to free, spurious memory validation errors will
occur when memory debugging is enabled.  Should you use \fBfree\fR to free
memory allocated by \fBckalloc\fR, memory corruption will occur when memory
debugging is enabled.  Any memory that is to be become the property of the Tcl
interpreter, such as result space, must be allocated with \fBckalloc\fR.  If
it is absolutely necessary for an application to pass back \fBmalloc\fRed
memory to Tcl, it will work only if Tcl is complied with the
\fBTCL_MEM_DEBUG\fR flag turned off.  If you convert your application to use
this facility, it will help you find memory over runs and lost memory.  Note
that memory allocated by a C library routine requiring freeing should still be
freed with \fBfree\fR, since it calls \fBmalloc\fR rather than \fBckalloc\fR
to do the allocation.
.PP
Parmeters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIptr\fR - The address of a block to free, as returned by ckalloc.
.RE
.sp
'
.SS Tcl_DumpActiveMemory
.PP 
This function will output a list of all currently allocated memory to the
specified file.  The following information is outputted for each allocated
block of memory: starting and ending addresses (excluding guard zone), size,
source file where \fBckalloc\fR was called to allocate the block and line
number in that file.  It is especially useful to call
\fBTcl_DumpActiveMemory\fR after the Tcl interpreter has been deleted.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIfileName\fR - The name of the file to output the memory list to.
.RE
'
.SS Tcl_ValidateAllMemory
.PP
Forces a validation of the guard zones of all currently allocated blocks
of memory.  Normally validation of a block occurs when its freed, unless
full validation is enabled, in which case validation of all blocks
occurs when \fBckalloc\fR and \fBckfree\fR are called.  This function forces
the validation to occur at any point.
.PP
Parameters:
.RS 2
\fBo \fIfile\fR - The file that this routine is being called from, normally
\fB__FILE__\fR.
.br
\fBo \fIline\fR - The line that this routine is being called from, normally
\fB__LINE__\fR.
.RE
'
.SH ENABLING MEMORY DEBUGGING
.PP
To enable memory debugging, Tcl should be recompiled from scratch with
\fBTCL_MEM_DEBUG\fR defined.  This will also compile in
a non-stub version of \fBTcl_InitMemory\fR
to add the \fBmemory\fR command to Tcl.
.PP
\fBTCL_MEM_DEBUG\fR must be either left defined for all modules or undefined
for all modules that are going to be linked together.  If they are not, link
errors will occur, with either \fBTclDbCkfree\fR and \fBTcl_DbCkalloc\fR or
\fBTcl_Ckalloc\fR and \fBTcl_Ckfree\fR being undefined.
'
.SH GUARD ZONES
.PP
When memory debugging is enabled, whenever a call to \fBckalloc\fR is
made, slightly more memory than requested is allocated so the memory debugging
code can keep track
of the allocated memory, and also 
eight-byte ``guard zones'' are placed in front of and behind the space that 
will be returned to the caller.  (The size of the guard zone is defined
by the C #define \fBGUARD_SIZE\fR in \fIbaseline/src/ckalloc.c\fR -- it
can be extended if you suspect large overwrite problems, at some cost in
performance.)  A known pattern is written into the guard zones and,
on a call to \fBckfree\fR, the guard zones of the space being freed
are checked to see if either zone has been modified in any way.
If one has been, the guard bytes and their new contents are identified,
and a ``low guard failed'' or ``high guard failed'' message is issued.
The ``guard failed'' message includes the address of the memory packet 
and the file name and line number of the code that called \fBckfree\fR.
This allows you to detect the common sorts of one-off problems, where
not enough space was allocated to contain the data written, for example.

.SH THE MEMORY COMMAND
.TP
.B memory \fIoptions\fR
.br
The Tcl \fBmemory\fR command gives the Tcl developer control of Tcl's memory
debugging capabilities.  The memory command has several suboptions, which are
described below.  It is only available when Tcl has been compiled with memory
debugging enabled.
'
.TP
.B memory \fBinfo\fR
.br
生成一个报告，包含自从 Tcl 启动以来分配和释放的(内存)总数，当前分配的包(未遇到相应的到 \fBckfree \fR的调用的到 \fBckalloc\fR  的调用的当前数目)的数目，当前分配的字节数，和已分配的包和字节的最大的数目。
'
.TP
.B memory \fBtrace\fR [\fBon|off\fR]
.br
使内存跟踪开启或关闭。在开启内存跟踪的时候，对 \fBckalloc\fR    的每次调用都导致向      \fIstderr \fR写一行跟踪信息，其组成有字 \fIckalloc\fR，随后是返回的地址，分配的内存总数，和进行分配的 C 文件名和代码的行数。例如:...
.sp
   \fBckalloc 40e478 98 tclProc.c 1406\fR
.sp
Calls to \fBckfree\fR are traced in the same manner, except that the
word \fIckalloc\fR is replaced by the word \fIckfree\fR.
'
.TP
.B memory \fBvalidate\fR [\fBon|off\fR]
.br
使内存生效(validation)开启或关闭。在开启内存生效的时候，在对\fBckalloc\fR 或 \fBckfree \fR的每次调用上，检查用 \fBckalloc \fR分配的每块现存的内存的守卫区(guard zone)。这有很大的性能影响而只在强烈怀疑有覆写(overwrite)问题的时候才使用。开启内存生效的益处是在覆写发生之后第一次调用 \fBckalloc\fR   或 \fBckfree\fR   的时候就能检测到守卫区覆写，而不是在释放有覆写守卫区的内存的时候，释放可能在内存覆写发生之后才发生。
'
.TP
.B memory \fBtrace_on_at_malloc\fR \fInnn\fR
.br
在进行了 \fIcount\fR\fI \fR数目 \fBckalloc \fR之后启用内存跟踪。例如，如果你键入了 \fBmemory trace_on_at_malloc 100\fR，在第   100 次调用 \fBckalloc \fR之后，将对所有分配和释放的内存显示内存跟踪信息。因为在一个问题发生之前可能有许多内存活动，如果你能在问题出现( sets in)之前标识出一定数目的分配，决定(judicious)使用这个选项可以减轻跟踪导致的速度变慢(和生成的跟踪信息总数)。在发生一个守卫区错误时，输出自从 Tcl  启动以来发生的内存分配的当前数目。     
.TP
.B memory \fBbreak_on_malloc\fR \fInnn\fR
.br
在进行了 \fB\fIcount\fR\fR  数目的 \fBckalloc\fR  分配之后，输出一个(中断)消息，表示它现在想进入 C 调试器。  Tcl  将向自身发出一个 \fISIGINT\fR  信号。如果你在一个 C  调试器下运行 Tcl，它将接着进入调试器命令模式。     
'
.TP
.B memory \fBdisplay\fR \fIfile\fR
.br
向指定文件写当前所有分配的内存的一个列表。
'
.SH DEBUGGING DIFFICULT MEMORY CORRUPTION PROBLEMS
.PP
Normally, Tcl compiled with memory debugging enabled will make it easy to isolate
a corruption problem.  Turning on memory validation with the memory command
can help isolate difficult problems.
If you suspect (or know) that corruption is 
occurring before the Tcl interpreter comes up far enough for you to
issue commands, you can set \fBMEM_VALIDATE\fR define, recompile 
tclCkalloc.c and rebuild Tcl.  This will enable memory validation
from the first call to \fBckalloc\fR, again, at a large performance impact.
.PP
If you are desperate and validating memory on every call to \fBckalloc\fR
and \fBckfree\fR isn't enough, you can explicitly call
\fBTcl_ValidateAllMemory\fR directly at any point.  It takes a \fIchar *\fR
and an \fIint\fR which are normally the filename and line number of the
caller, but they can actually be anything you want.  Remember to remove
the calls after you find the problem.
