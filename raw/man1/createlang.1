.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcreatelang\fR is a utility for adding a new 
programming language to a PostgreSQL database.
\fBcreatelang\fR can handle all the languages
supplied in the default PostgreSQL distribution, but
not languages provided by other parties.
.PP
Although backend programming languages can be added directly using
several SQL commands, it is recommended to use
\fBcreatelang\fR because it performs a number
of checks and is much easier to use. See
CREATE LANGUAGE [\fBcreate_language\fR(7)]
for additional information.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBcreatelang\fR accepts the following command-line arguments:
.TP
\fB\fIlangname\fB\fR
Specifies the name of the procedural programming language to be
defined.
.TP
\fB[-d] \fIdbname\fB\fR
.TP
\fB[--dbname] \fIdbname\fB\fR
Specifies to which database the language should be added.
The default is to use the database with the same name as the
current system user.
.TP
\fB-e\fR
.TP
\fB--echo\fR
Display SQL commands as they are executed.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
.TP
\fB--list\fR
Show a list of already installed languages in the target database.
.TP
\fB-L \fIdirectory\fB\fR
Specifies the directory in which the language interpreter is
to be found. The directory is normally found automatically; this
option is primarily for debugging purposes.
.PP
.PP
\fBcreatelang\fR also accepts 
the following command-line arguments for connection parameters:
.TP
\fB-h \fIhost\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--host \fIhost\fB\fR
Specifies the host name of the machine on which the 
server
is running. If the value begins with a slash, it is used 
as the directory for the Unix domain socket.
.TP
\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--port \fIport\fB\fR
Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server
is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR
.TP
\fB--username \fIusername\fB\fR
User name to connect as.
.TP
\fB-W\fR
.TP
\fB--password\fR
Force password prompt.
.PP
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.TP
\fBPGDATABASE\fR
.TP
\fBPGHOST\fR
.TP
\fBPGPORT\fR
.TP
\fBPGUSER\fR
Default connection parameters
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
Most error messages are self-explanatory. If not, run
\fBcreatelang\fR with the \fB--echo\fR
option and see under the respective SQL command
for details.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Use \fBdroplang\fR(1) to remove a language.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To install the language pltcl into the database
template1:
.sp
.nf
$ \fBcreatelang pltcl template1\fR
.sp
.fi
