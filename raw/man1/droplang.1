.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdroplang\fR is a utility for removing an 
existing programming language from a
PostgreSQL database.
\fBdroplang\fR can drop any procedural language,
even those not supplied by the PostgreSQL distribution.
.PP
Although backend programming languages can be removed directly using
several SQL commands, it is recommended to use
\fBdroplang\fR because it performs a number
of checks and is much easier to use. See
DROP LANGUAGE [\fBdrop_language\fR(7)]
for more.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBdroplang\fR accepts the following command line arguments:
.TP
\fB\fIlangname\fB\fR

.TP
\fB[-d] \fIdbname\fB\fR
.TP
\fB[--dbname] \fIdbname\fB\fR
Specifies from which database the language should be removed.
The default is to use the database with the same name as the
current system user.
.TP

as the directory for the Unix domain socket.

Specifies the Internet TCP/IP port or local Unix domain socket file 
extension on which the server
is listening for connections.
.TP
\fB-U \fIusername\fB\fR

\fBdroplang\fR with the \fB--echo\fR
option and see under the respective SQL command
for details.
