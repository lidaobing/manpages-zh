.SH NAME
termcap \- terminal capability database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The termcap database is an obsolete facility for describing the
capabilities of character-cell terminals and printers.
It is retained only for capability with old programs;
new ones should use the
.BR terminfo (5)
database and associated libraries.
.LP
.I /etc/termcap
is an ASCII file (the database master) that lists the capabilities of
many different types of terminals.
Programs can read termcap to find
the particular escape codes needed to control the visual attributes of
the terminal actually in use.
(Other aspects of the terminal are
handled by
.BR stty (1).)
The termcap database is indexed on the
.B TERM
environment variable.
.LP
Termcap entries must be defined on a single logical line, with \(aq\\\(aq
used to suppress the newline.
Fields are separated by \(aq:\(aq.
The first field of each entry starts at the left-hand margin,
and contains a list of names for the terminal, separated by \(aq|\(aq.
.LP
The first subfield may (in BSD termcap entries from versions 4.3 and
prior) contain a short name consisting of two characters.
This short name may consist of capital or small letters.
In 4.4BSD termcap entries this field is omitted.
.LP
The second subfield (first, in the newer 4.4BSD format) contains the
name used by the environment variable
.BR TERM .
It should be spelled in lowercase letters.
Selectable hardware capabilities should be marked
by appending a hyphen and a suffix to this name.
See below for an example.
Usual suffixes are w (more than 80 characters wide), am
(automatic margins), nam (no automatic margins), and rv (reverse video
display).
The third subfield contains a long and descriptive name for
this termcap entry.
.LP
Subsequent fields contain the terminal capabilities; any continued
capability lines must be indented one tab from the left margin.
.LP
Although there is no defined order, it is suggested to write first
boolean, then numeric, and then string capabilities, each sorted
alphabetically without looking at lower or upper spelling.
Capabilities of similar functions can be written in one line.
.LP
.nf
Example for:
.sp
Head line: vt|vt101|DEC VT 101 terminal in 80 character mode:\e
Head line: Vt|vt101-w|DEC VT 101 terminal in (wide) 132 character mode:\e

.LP
There are several ways of defining the control codes for string capabilities:
.LP
Every normal character represents itself,
except \(aq^\(aq, \(aq\e\(aq, and \(aq%\(aq.
.LP
A \fB^x\fP means Control-x.
Control-A equals 1 decimal.
.LP
\ex means a special code.
x can be one of the following characters:
.RS
E Escape (27)
.br
n Linefeed (10)
.br
r Carriage return (13)
.br
t Tabulation (9)
.br
b Backspace (8)
.br
f Form feed (12)
.br
0 Null character.
A \exxx specifies the octal character xxx.
.RE
.IP i
Increments parameters by one.
.IP r
Single parameter capability
.IP +
Add value of next character to this parameter and do binary output
.IP 2
Do ASCII output of this parameter with a field with of 2
.IP d
Do ASCII output of this parameter with a field with of 3
.IP %
Print a \(aq%\(aq
.LP
If you use binary output, then you should avoid the null character (\(aq\\0\(aq)
because it terminates the string.
You should reset tabulator expansion
if a tabulator can be the binary output of a parameter.
.IP Warning:
The above metacharacters for parameters may be wrong, they document Minix
termcap which may not be compatible with Linux termcap.
.LP
The block graphic characters can be specified by three string capabilities:
.IP as
start the alternative charset
.IP ae
end it
.IP ac
pairs of characters.
The first character is the name of the block graphic
symbol and the second characters is its definition.
.LP
The following names are available:
.sp
.nf
+	right arrow (>)
,	left arrow (<)
\&.	down arrow (v)
0	full square (#)
I	lantern (#)
-	upper arrow (^)
\&'	rhombus (+)
a	chess board (:)
f	degree (')
g	plus-minus (#)
h	square (#)
j	right bottom corner (+)
k	right upper corner (+)
l	left upper corner (+)
m	left bottom corner (+)
n	cross (+)
o	upper horizontal line (-)
q	middle horizontal line (-)
s	bottom horizontal line (_)
t	left tee (+)
u	right tee (+)
v	bottom tee (+)
w	normal tee (+)
x	vertical line (|)
~	paragraph (???)
.fi
.sp
The values in parentheses are suggested defaults which are used by curses,
if the capabilities are missing.
