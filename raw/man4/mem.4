.SH NAME
mem, kmem, port \- system memory, kernel memory and system ports
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mem
is a character device file
that is an image of the main memory of the computer.
It may be used, for example, to examine (and even patch) the system.
.LP
Byte addresses in
.B mem
are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
References to nonexistent locations cause errors to be returned.
.LP
Examining and patching is likely to lead to unexpected results
when read-only or write-only bits are present.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod \-m 660 /dev/mem c 1 1
.br
chown root:kmem /dev/mem
.RE
.LP
The file
.B kmem
is the same as
.BR mem ,
except that the kernel virtual memory
rather than physical memory is accessed.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod \-m 640 /dev/kmem c 1 2
.br
chown root:kmem /dev/kmem
.RE
.LP
.B port
is similar to
.BR mem ,
but the I/O ports are accessed.
.LP
It is typically created by:
.RS
.sp
mknod \-m 660 /dev/port c 1 4
.br
chown root:mem /dev/port
.RE
.SH FILES
.I /dev/mem
