.SH NAME
console_codes \- Linux console escape and control sequences
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Linux console implements a large subset of the VT102 and ECMA-48/ISO
6429/ANSI X3.64 terminal controls, plus certain private-mode sequences
for changing the color palette, character-set mapping, and so on.
In the tabular descriptions below, the second column gives ECMA-48 or DEC
mnemonics (the latter if prefixed with DEC) for the given function.
Sequences without a mnemonic are neither ECMA-48 nor VT102.
.LP
After all the normal output processing has been done, and a
stream of characters arrives at the console driver for actual
printing, the first thing that happens is a translation from
the code used for processing to the code used for printing.
.LP
If the console is in UTF-8 mode, then the incoming bytes are
first assembled into 16-bit Unicode codes.
Otherwise each byte is transformed according to the current mapping table
(which translates it to a Unicode value).
See the \fBCharacter Sets\fP section below for discussion.
.LP
In the normal case, the Unicode value is converted to a font index,
and this is stored in video memory, so that the corresponding glyph
(as found in video ROM) appears on the screen.
Note that the use of Unicode (and the design of the PC hardware)
allows us to use 512 different glyphs simultaneously.
.LP
If the current Unicode value is a control character, or we are
currently processing an escape sequence, the value will treated
specially.
Instead of being turned into a font index and rendered as
a glyph, it may trigger cursor movement or other control functions.
See the \fBLinux Console Controls\fP section below for discussion.
.LP
It is generally not good practice to hard-wire terminal controls into
programs.
Linux supports a
.BR terminfo (5)
database of terminal capabilities.
Rather than emitting console escape sequences by hand, you will almost
always want to use a terminfo-aware screen library or utility such as
.BR ncurses (3),
.BR tput (1),
or
.BR reset (1).
.SS Linux console controls
This section describes all the control characters and escape sequences
that invoke special functions (i.e., anything other than writing a
glyph at the current cursor location) on the Linux console.
.PP
.B "Control characters"
.sp
A character is a control character if (before transformation
according to the mapping table) it has one of the 14 codes
00 (NUL), 07 (BEL), 08 (BS), 09 (HT), 0a (LF), 0b (VT),
0c (FF), 0d (CR), 0e (SO), 0f (SI), 18 (CAN), 1a (SUB),
1b (ESC), 7f (DEL).
One can set a "display control characters" mode (see below),
and allow 07, 09, 0b, 18, 1a, 7f to be displayed as glyphs.
On the other hand, in UTF-8 mode all codes 00-1f are regarded
as control characters, regardless of any "display control characters"
mode.
.PP
If we have a control character, it is acted upon immediately
and then discarded (even in the middle of an escape sequence)
and the escape sequence continues with the next character.
(However, ESC starts a new escape sequence, possibly aborting a previous
unfinished one, and CAN and SUB abort any escape sequence.)
The recognized control characters are BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF,
CR, SO, SI, CAN, SUB, ESC, DEL, CSI.
They do what one would expect:
.HP
BEL (0x07, \fB^G\fP) beeps;
.HP
BS (0x08, \fB^H\fP) backspaces one column
(but not past the beginning of the line);
.HP
HT (0x09, \fB^I\fP) goes to the next tab stop or to the end of the line
if there is no earlier tab stop;
.HP
LF (0x0A, \fB^J\fP), VT (0x0B, \fB^K\fP) and
FF (0x0C, \fB^L\fP) all give a linefeed,
and if LF/NL (new-line mode) is set also a carriage return;
.HP
CR (0x0D, \fB^M\fP) gives a carriage return;
.HP
SO (0x0E, \fB^N\fP) activates the G1 character set;
.HP
SI (0x0F, \fB^O\fP) activates the G0 character set;
.HP
CAN (0x18, \fB^X\fP) and SUB (0x1A, \fB^Z\fP) interrupt escape sequences;
.HP
ESC (0x1B, \fB^[\fP) starts an escape sequence;
.HP
DEL (0x7F) is ignored;
.HP
CSI (0x9B) is equivalent to ESC [.

.PP
.B "ECMA-48 CSI sequences"
.sp
CSI (or ESC [) is followed by a sequence of parameters,
at most NPAR (16), that are decimal numbers separated by
semicolons.
An empty or absent parameter is taken to be 0.
The sequence of parameters may be preceded by a single question mark.
.PP
However, after CSI [ (or ESC [ [) a single character is read
and this entire sequence is ignored.
(The idea is to ignore an echoed function key.)
.PP
The action of a CSI sequence is determined by its final character.

The following sequences are neither ECMA-48 nor native VT102.
They are native to the Linux console driver.

0 = black, 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = brown, 4 = blue, 5 = magenta, 6 =
cyan, 7 = white.

.TE
.SS Character sets
The kernel knows about 4 translations of bytes into console-screen
symbols.
The four tables are: a) Latin1 \-> PC,
b) VT100 graphics \-> PC, c) PC \-> PC, d) user-defined.
.PP
There are two character sets, called G0 and G1, and one of them
is the current character set.
(Initially G0.)
Typing \fB^N\fP causes G1 to become current,
\fB^O\fP causes G0 to become current.
.PP
These variables G0 and G1 point at a translation table, and can be
changed by the user.
Initially they point at tables a) and b), respectively.
The sequences ESC ( B and ESC ( 0 and ESC ( U and ESC ( K cause G0 to
point at translation table a), b), c) and d), respectively.
The sequences ESC ) B and ESC ) 0 and ESC ) U and ESC ) K cause G1 to
point at translation table a), b), c) and d), respectively.
.PP
The sequence ESC c causes a terminal reset, which is what you want if the
screen is all garbled.
The oft-advised "echo ^V^O" will make only G0 current,
but there is no guarantee that G0 points at table a).
In some distributions there is a program
.BR reset (1)
that just does "echo ^[c".
If your terminfo entry for the console is correct
(and has an entry rs1=\\Ec), then "tput reset" will also work.
.PP
The user-defined mapping table can be set using
.BR mapscrn (8).
The result of the mapping is that if a symbol c is printed, the symbol
s = map[c] is sent to the video memory.
The bitmap that corresponds to
s is found in the character ROM, and can be changed using
.BR setfont (8).
.SS Mouse tracking
The mouse tracking facility is intended to return
.BR xterm (1)-compatible
mouse status reports.
Because the console driver has no way to know
the device or type of the mouse, these reports are returned in the
console input stream only when the virtual terminal driver receives
a mouse update ioctl.
These ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware
user-mode application such as the
.BR gpm (8)
daemon.
.PP
The mouse tracking escape sequences generated by
\fBxterm\fP(1) encode numeric parameters in a single character as
\fIvalue\fP+040.
For example, \(aq!\(aq is 1.
The screen coordinate system is 1-based.
.PP
The X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence on button press
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.
It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 9 h and disabled with ESC [ ? 9 l.
On button press, \fBxterm\fP(1) sends
ESC [ M \fIbxy\fP (6 characters).
Here \fIb\fP is button\-1,
and \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are the x and y coordinates of the mouse
when the button was pressed.
This is the same code the kernel also produces.
.PP
Normal tracking mode (not implemented in Linux 2.0.24) sends an escape
sequence on both button press and release.
Modifier information is also sent.
It is enabled by sending ESC [ ? 1000 h and disabled with
ESC [ ? 1000 l.
On button press or release, \fBxterm\fP(1) sends ESC [ M
\fIbxy\fP.
The low two bits of \fIb\fP encode button information:
0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
The upper bits encode what modifiers were down when the button was
pressed and are added together: 4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.
Again \fIx\fP and
\fIy\fP are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.
The upper left corner is (1,1).
.SS Comparisons with other terminals
Many different terminal types are described, like the Linux console,
as being "VT100-compatible".
Here we discuss differences between the
Linux console and the two most important others, the DEC VT102 and
.BR xterm (1).
.\"
.PP
.B Control-character handling

The VT102 also recognized the following control characters:

NUL (0x00) was ignored;
.HP
ENQ (0x05) triggered an answerback message;
.HP
DC1 (0x11, \fB^Q\fP, XON) resumed transmission;
.HP
DC3 (0x13, \fB^S\fP, XOFF) caused VT100 to ignore (and stop transmitting)
all codes except XOFF and XON.
.LP
VT100-like DC1/DC3 processing may be enabled by the terminal driver.
.LP
The
.BR xterm (1)
program (in VT100 mode) recognizes the control characters
BEL, BS, HT, LF, VT, FF, CR, SO, SI, ESC.

ESC X	SOS	Start of string.
ESC ^	PM	Privacy message (ended by ESC \\)
ESC \\	ST	String terminator
ESC * ...		Designate G2 character set

.TE
.PP
The program
.BR xterm (1)
(in VT100 mode) recognizes ESC c, ESC # 8, ESC >, ESC =,
ESC D, ESC E, ESC H, ESC M, ESC N, ESC O, ESC P ... ESC \\,
ESC Z (it answers ESC [ ? 1 ; 2 c, "I am a VT100 with
advanced video option")
and ESC ^ ... ESC \\ with the same meanings as indicated above.
It accepts ESC (, ESC ), ESC *,  ESC + followed by 0, A, B for
the DEC special character and line drawing set, UK, and US-ASCII,
respectively.
.PP
The user can configure \fBxterm\fP(1) to respond to VT220-specific
control sequences, and it will identify itself as a VT52, VT100, and
up depending on the way it is configured and initialized.
.PP
It accepts ESC ] (OSC) for the setting of certain resources.
In addition to the ECMA-48 string terminator (ST),
\fBxterm\fP(1) accepts a BEL to terminate an OSC string.
These are a few of the OSC control sequences recognized by \fBxterm\fP(1):
.TS
l l.
ESC ] 0 ; \fItxt\fP ST	Set icon name and window title to \fItxt\fP.
ESC ] 1 ; \fItxt\fP ST	Set icon name to \fItxt\fP.

It also recognizes ESC % and provides a more complete UTF-8
implementation than Linux console.
.\"
.PP
.B CSI Sequences
.sp
Old versions of \fBxterm\fP(1), for example, from X11R5,
interpret the blink SGR as a bold SGR.
Later versions which implemented ANSI colors, for example,
XFree86 3.1.2A in 1995, improved this by allowing
the blink attribute to be displayed as a color.
Modern versions of xterm implement blink SGR as blinking text
and still allow colored text as an alternate rendering of SGRs.
Stock X11R6 versions did not recognize the color-setting SGRs until
the X11R6.8 release, which incorporated XFree86 xterm.
All ECMA-48 CSI sequences recognized by Linux are also recognized by
.IR xterm ,
however \fBxterm\fP(1) implements several ECMA-48 and DEC control sequences
not recognized by Linux.
.PP
The \fBxterm\fP(1)
program recognizes all of the DEC Private Mode sequences listed
above, but none of the Linux private-mode sequences.
For discussion of \fBxterm\fP(1)'s
own private-mode sequences, refer to the
\fIXterm Control Sequences\fP
document by
Edward Moy,
Stephen Gildea,
and Thomas E. Dickey
available with the X distribution.

.SH NOTES
ESC 8 (DECRC) is not able to restore the character set changed with
ESC %.
.SH BUGS
In 2.0.23, CSI is broken, and NUL is not ignored inside
escape sequences.
.PP
Some older kernel versions (after 2.0) interpret 8-bit control
sequences.
These "C1 controls" use codes between 128 and 159 to replace
ESC [, ESC ] and similar two-byte control sequence initiators.
There are fragments of that in modern kernels (either overlooked or
broken by changes to support UTF-8),
but the implementation is incomplete and should be regarded
as unreliable.
.PP
Linux "private mode" sequences do not follow the rules in ECMA-48
for private mode control sequences.
In particular, those ending with ] do not use a standard terminating
character.
The OSC (set palette) sequence is a greater problem,
since \fBxterm\fP(1) may interpret this as a control sequence
which requires a string terminator (ST).
Unlike the \fBsetterm\fP(1) sequences which will be ignored (since
they are invalid control sequences), the palette sequence will make
\fBxterm\fP(1) appear to hang (though pressing the return-key
will fix that).
To accommodate applications which have been hardcoded to use Linux
control sequences,
set the \fBxterm\fP(1) resource \fBbrokenLinuxOSC\fP to true.
.PP
An older version of this document implied that Linux recognizes the
ECMA-48 control sequence for invisible text.
It is ignored.
