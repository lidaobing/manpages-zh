POSIX PAGES
This package used to contains a copy of the POSIX 1003.1-2003
man pages.  The POSIX pages are now distributed in the separate
man-pages-posix package.

THE PAGES
These pages are most of the section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 man pages
for Linux.  A few pages are provided in sections 1 and 8 for commands
that are not documented in other packages, and there are a few pages
in sections 5 and 8 for the timezone utilities.

[The timezone pages were taken from
ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzcode2001a.tar.gz.]
[The section 3 man pages for the db routines have been taken from
ftp://ftp.terra.net/pub/sleepycat/db.1.86.tar.gz.]
[The rpc man pages were taken from the 4.4BSD-Lite CDROM.]

Here is a breakdown of what this distribution contains:

    Section 1 = user commands (intro, plus a few other pages)
    Section 2 = system calls
    Section 3 = libc calls
    Section 4 = devices (e.g., hd, sd)
    Section 5 = file formats and protocols (e.g., wtmp, /etc/passwd, nfs)
    Section 6 = games (intro only)
    Section 7 = overviews, conventions, macro packages, etc.
    Section 8 = system administration (intro, plus a few other pages)

    This package contains no, or very few, section 1, 6, and 8 man pages
    because these should be distributed with the binaries they are written
    for.  Sometimes Section 9 is used for man pages describing parts of
    the kernel.

    Note that only Section 2 is rather complete, but Section 3 contains
    several hundred man pages.  If you want to write some man pages,
    or suggest improvments to existing pages, please visit
