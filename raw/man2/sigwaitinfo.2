.TH SIGWAITINFO 2 2013-09-04 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigwaitinfo, sigtimedwait \- synchronously wait for queued signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

.sp
.BI "int sigwaitinfo(const sigset_t *" set ", siginfo_t *" info ");"
.sp
.BI "int sigtimedwait(const sigset_t *" set ", siginfo_t *" info ", "

Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
.in
.sp
.BR sigwaitinfo (),
.BR sigtimedwait ():
_POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 199309L
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
suspends execution of the calling thread until one of the signals in
.I set
is pending
(If one of the signals in
.I set
is already pending for the calling thread,
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
will return immediately.)

.BR sigwaitinfo ()
removes the signal from the set of pending
signals and returns the signal number as its function result.
If the
.I info
argument is not NULL,
then the buffer that it points to is used to return a structure of type
.I siginfo_t
(see
.BR sigaction (2))
containing information about the signal.
.PP
If multiple signals in
.I set
are pending for the caller, the signal that is retrieved by
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
is determined according to the usual ordering rules; see
.BR signal (7)
for further details.
.PP
.BR sigtimedwait ()
operates in exactly the same way as
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
except that it has an additional argument,
.IR timeout ,
which specifies the interval for which
the thread is suspended waiting for a signal.
(This interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity,
and kernel scheduling delays mean that the interval
may overrun by a small amount.)
This argument is of the following type:
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
struct timespec {
    long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
    long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
}
.fi
.in
.sp
If both fields of this structure are specified as 0, a poll is performed:
.BR sigtimedwait ()
returns immediately, either with information about a signal that
was pending for the caller, or with an error
if none of the signals in
.I set
was pending.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, both
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
and
.BR sigtimedwait ()
return a signal number (i.e., a value greater than zero).
On failure both calls return \-1, with
.I errno
set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
No signal in
.I set
was became pending within the
.I timeout
period specified to
.BR sigtimedwait ().
.TP
.B EINTR
The wait was interrupted by a signal handler; see
.BR signal (7).
(This handler was for a signal other than one of those in
.IR set .)
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I timeout
was invalid.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
In normal usage, the calling program blocks the signals in
.I set
via a prior call to
.BR sigprocmask (2)
(so that the default disposition for these signals does not occur if they
become pending between successive calls to
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
or
.BR sigtimedwait ())
and does not establish handlers for these signals.
In a multithreaded program,
the signal should be blocked in all threads, in order to prevent
the signal being treated according to its default disposition in
a thread other than the one calling
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
or
.BR sigtimedwait ()).

The set of signals that is pending for a given thread is the
union of the set of signals that is pending specifically for that thread
and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole (see
.BR signal (7)).

Attempts to wait for
.B SIGKILL
and
.B SIGSTOP
are silently ignored.

If multiple threads of a process are blocked
waiting for the same signal(s) in
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
or
.BR sigtimedwait (),
then exactly one of the threads will actually receive the
signal if it becomes pending for the process as a whole;
which of the threads receives the signal is indeterminate.

POSIX leaves the meaning of a NULL value for the
.I timeout
argument of
.BR sigtimedwait ()
unspecified, permitting the possibility that this has the same meaning
as a call to
.BR sigwaitinfo (),
and indeed this is what is done on Linux.

On Linux,
.BR sigwaitinfo ()
is a library function implemented on top of
.BR sigtimedwait ().
