.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR fsync ()
transfers ("flushes") all modified in-core data of
(i.e., modified buffer cache pages for) the
file referred to by the file descriptor
.I fd
to the disk device (or other permanent storage device) so that all
changed information can be retrieved even after the system crashed or
was rebooted.
This includes writing through or flushing a disk cache if present.
The call blocks until the device reports that the transfer has completed.
It also flushes metadata information associated with the file (see
.BR stat (2)).

Calling
.BR fsync ()
does not necessarily ensure
that the entry in the directory containing the file has also reached disk.
For that an explicit
.BR fsync ()
on a file descriptor for the directory is also needed.

.BR fdatasync ()
is similar to
.BR fsync (),
but does not flush modified metadata unless that metadata
is needed in order to allow a subsequent data retrieval to be
correctly handled.
For example, changes to
.I st_atime
or
.I st_mtime
(respectively, time of last access and
time of last modification; see
.BR stat (2))
do not require flushing because they are not necessary for
a subsequent data read to be handled correctly.
On the other hand, a change to the file size
.RI ( st_size ,
as made by say
.BR ftruncate (2)),
would require a metadata flush.

The aim of
.BR fdatasync ()
is to reduce disk activity for applications that do not
require all metadata to be synchronized with the disk.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these system calls return zero.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EIO
An error occurred during synchronization.
.TP
.BR EROFS ", " EINVAL
.I fd
is bound to a special file which does not support synchronization.
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH AVAILABILITY
On POSIX systems on which
.BR fdatasync ()
is available,
.B _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO
is defined in
.I <unistd.h>
to a value greater than 0.
(See also
.BR sysconf (3).)
.\" POSIX.1-2001: It shall be defined to -1 or 0 or 200112L.
.\" -1: unavailable, 0: ask using sysconf().
.\" glibc defines them to 1.
.SH NOTES
On some UNIX systems (but not Linux),
.I fd
must be a
.I writable
file descriptor.

In Linux 2.2 and earlier,
.BR fdatasync ()
is equivalent to
.BR fsync (),
and so has no performance advantage.

The
.BR fsync ()
implementations in older kernels and lesser used filesystems
does not know how to flush disk caches.
In these cases disk caches need to be disabled using
.BR hdparm (8)
or
.BR sdparm (8)
to guarantee safe operation.
