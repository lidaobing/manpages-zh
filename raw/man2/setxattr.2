.SH DESCRIPTION
Extended attributes are
.IR name :\c
.I value
pairs associated with inodes (files, directories, symbolic links, etc.).
They are extensions to the normal attributes which are associated
with all inodes in the system (i.e., the
.BR stat (2)
data).
A complete overview of extended attributes concepts can be found in
.BR attr (5).
.PP
.BR setxattr ()
sets the
.I value
of the extended attribute identified by
.I name
and associated with the given
.I path
in the filesystem.
The
.I size
of the
.I value
must be specified.
.PP
.BR lsetxattr ()
is identical to
.BR setxattr (),
except in the case of a symbolic link, where the extended attribute is
set on the link itself, not the file that it refers to.
.PP
.BR fsetxattr ()
is identical to
.BR setxattr (),
only the extended attribute is set on the open file referred to by
.I fd
(as returned by
.BR open (2))
in place of
.IR path .
.PP
An extended attribute name is a simple null-terminated string.
The
.I name
includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint
namespaces associated with an individual inode.
The
.I value
of an extended attribute is a chunk of arbitrary textual or
binary data of specified length.
.PP
The
.I flags
argument can be used to refine the semantics of the operation.
.B XATTR_CREATE
specifies a pure create, which fails if the named
attribute exists already.
.B XATTR_REPLACE
specifies a pure replace operation, which fails if the
named attribute does not already exist.
By default (no flags), the extended attribute will be created if
need be, or will simply replace the value if the attribute exists.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On failure, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EDQUOT
Disk quota limits meant that
there is insufficient space remaining to store the extended attribute.
.TP
.B EEXIST
.B XATTR_CREATE
was specified, and the attribute exists already.
.TP
.B ENOATTR
.B XATTR_REPLACE
was specified, and the attribute does not exist.
.RB ( ENOATTR
is defined to be a synonym for
.BR ENODATA
in
.IR <attr/xattr.h> .)
.TP
.B ENOSPC
There is insufficient space remaining to store the extended attribute.
.TP
.B ENOTSUP
Extended attributes are not supported by the filesystem, or are disabled,
.I errno
is set to
.BR ENOTSUP .
.PP
In addition, the errors documented in
.BR stat (2)
can also occur.
.SH VERSIONS
These system calls have been available on Linux since kernel 2.4;
glibc support is provided since version 2.3.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These system calls are Linux-specific.
