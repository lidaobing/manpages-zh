.TH MMAP2 2 2012-04-16 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
mmap2 \- map files or devices into memory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/mman.h>
.sp
.BI "void *mmap2(void *" addr ", size_t " length ", int " prot ,
.BI "             int " flags ", int " fd ", off_t " pgoffset );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is probably not the system call that you are interested in; instead, see
.BR mmap (2),
which describes the glibc wrapper function that invokes this system call.

The
.BR mmap2 ()
system call provides the same interface as
.BR mmap (2),
except that the final argument specifies the offset into the
file in 4096-byte units (instead of bytes, as is done by
.BR mmap (2)).
This enables applications that use a 32-bit
.I off_t
to map large files (up to 2^44 bytes).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR mmap2 ()
returns a pointer to the mapped area.
On error \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
Problem with getting the data from user space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
(Various platforms where the page size is not 4096 bytes.)
.I "offset\ *\ 4096"
is not a multiple of the system page size.
.PP
.BR mmap2 ()
can also return any of the errors described in
.BR mmap (2).
.SH VERSIONS
.BR mmap2 ()
is available since Linux 2.3.31.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This system call is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
Nowadays, the glibc
.BR mmap ()
wrapper function invokes this system call rather than the
.BR mmap (2)
system call.

On ia64, the unit for
.I offset
is actually the system page size, rather than 4096 bytes.
.\" ia64 can have page sizes ranging from 4kB to 64kB.
.\" On cris, it looks like the unit might also be the page size,
.\" which is 8192 bytes. -- mtk, June 2007
