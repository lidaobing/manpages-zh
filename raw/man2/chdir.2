.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR chdir ()
changes the current working directory of the calling process to the
directory specified in
.IR path .
.PP
.BR fchdir ()
is identical to
.BR chdir ();
the only difference is that the directory is given as an
open file descriptor.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
Depending on the filesystem, other errors can be returned.
The more
general errors for
.BR chdir ()
are listed below:
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission is denied for one of the components of
.IR path .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I path
points outside your accessible address space.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
The file does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component of
.I path
is not a directory.
.PP
The general errors for
.BR fchdir ()
are listed below:
.TP
.B EACCES
Search permission was denied on the directory open on
.IR fd .
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.4BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The current working directory is the starting point for interpreting
relative pathnames (those not starting with \(aq/\(aq).

A child process created via
.BR fork (2)
inherits its parent's current working directory.
The current working directory is left unchanged by
.BR execve (2).
