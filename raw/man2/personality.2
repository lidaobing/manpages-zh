.TH PERSONALITY 2 2003-01-01 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
personality \- set the process execution domain
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/personality.h>
.sp
.BI "int personality(unsigned long " persona );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux supports different execution domains, or personalities, for each
process.
Among other things, execution domains tell Linux how to map
signal numbers into signal actions.
The execution domain system allows
Linux to provide limited support for binaries compiled under other
UNIX-like operating systems.

This function will return the current
.BR personality ()
when
.I persona
equals 0xffffffff.
Otherwise, it will make the execution domain
referenced by
.I persona
the new execution domain of the calling process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the previous
.I persona
is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The kernel was unable to change the personality.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR personality ()
is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to
be portable.
