.TH TIME 2 2011-09-09 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
time \- get time in seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <time.h>
.sp
.BI "time_t time(time_t *" t );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR time ()
returns the time as the number of seconds since the
Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).

If
.I t
is non-NULL,
the return value is also stored in the memory pointed to by
.IR t .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the value of time in seconds since the Epoch is returned.
On error, \fI((time_t)\ \-1)\fP is returned, and \fIerrno\fP is set
appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I t
points outside your accessible address space.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" .br
.\" Under 4.3BSD, this call is obsoleted by
.\" .BR gettimeofday (2).
POSIX does not specify any error conditions.
.SH NOTES
POSIX.1 defines
.I seconds since the Epoch
using a formula that approximates the number of seconds between a
specified time and the Epoch.
This formula takes account of the facts that
all years that are evenly divisible by 4 are leap years,
but years that are evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years
unless they are also evenly divisible by 400,
in which case they are leap years.
This value is not the same as the actual number of seconds between the time
and the Epoch, because of leap seconds and because system clocks are not
required to be synchronized to a standard reference.
The intention is that the interpretation of seconds since the Epoch values be
consistent; see POSIX.1-2008 Rationale A.4.15 for further rationale.
