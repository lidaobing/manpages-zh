.TH ALARM 2 2013-04-18 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
alarm \- set an alarm clock for delivery of a signal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "unsigned int alarm(unsigned int " seconds );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR alarm ()
arranges for a
.B SIGALRM
signal to be delivered to the calling process in
.I seconds
seconds.

If
.I seconds
is zero, any pending alarm is canceled.

In any event any previously set
.BR alarm ()
is canceled.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR alarm ()
returns the number of seconds remaining until any previously scheduled
alarm was due to be delivered, or zero if there was no previously
scheduled alarm.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
.BR alarm ()
and
.BR setitimer (2)
share the same timer; calls to one will interfere with use of the
other.
.PP
.BR sleep (3)
may be implemented using
.BR SIGALRM ;
mixing calls to
.BR alarm ()
and
.BR sleep (3)
is a bad idea.

Scheduling delays can, as ever, cause the execution of the process to
be delayed by an arbitrary amount of time.
