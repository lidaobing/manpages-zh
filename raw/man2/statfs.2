.TH STATFS 2 2010-11-21 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
statfs, fstatfs \- get filesystem statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "#include <sys/vfs.h>    " "/* or <sys/statfs.h> */"
.sp
.BI "int statfs(const char *" path ", struct statfs *" buf );
.br
.BI "int fstatfs(int " fd ", struct statfs *" buf );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR statfs ()
returns information about a mounted filesystem.
.I path
is the pathname of any file within the mounted filesystem.
.I buf
is a pointer to a
.I statfs
structure defined approximately as follows:

.in +4n
.nf
#if __WORDSIZE == 32		/* System word size */
# define __SWORD_TYPE           int
#else /* __WORDSIZE == 64 */
# define __SWORD_TYPE		long int
#endif

struct statfs {
    __SWORD_TYPE f_type;    /* type of filesystem (see below) */
    __SWORD_TYPE f_bsize;   /* optimal transfer block size */
    fsblkcnt_t   f_blocks;  /* total data blocks in filesystem */
    fsblkcnt_t   f_bfree;   /* free blocks in fs */
    fsblkcnt_t   f_bavail;  /* free blocks available to
                               unprivileged user */
    fsfilcnt_t   f_files;   /* total file nodes in filesystem */
    fsfilcnt_t   f_ffree;   /* free file nodes in fs */
    fsid_t       f_fsid;    /* filesystem id */
    __SWORD_TYPE f_namelen; /* maximum length of filenames */
    __SWORD_TYPE f_frsize;  /* fragment size (since Linux 2.6) */
    __SWORD_TYPE f_spare[5];
};

.in
.PP
Nobody knows what
.I f_fsid
is supposed to contain (but see below).
.PP
Fields that are undefined for a particular filesystem are set to 0.
.BR fstatfs ()
returns the same information about an open file referenced by descriptor
.IR fd .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
.RB ( statfs ())
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.IR path .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EBADF
.RB ( fstatfs ())
.I fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I buf
or
.I path
points to an invalid address.
.TP
.B EINTR
This call was interrupted by a signal.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from the filesystem.
.TP
.B ELOOP
.RB ( statfs ())
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.RB ( statfs ())
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
.RB ( statfs ())
The file referred to by
.I path
does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The filesystem does not support this call.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
.RB ( statfs ())
A component of the path prefix of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
Some values were too large to be represented in the returned struct.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Linux-specific.
The Linux
.BR statfs ()
was inspired by the 4.4BSD one
(but they do not use the same structure).
.SH NOTES
The original Linux
.BR statfs ()
and
.BR fstatfs ()
system calls were not designed with extremely large file sizes in mind.
Subsequently, Linux 2.6
added new
.BR statfs64 ()
and
.BR fstatfs64 ()
system calls that employ a new structure,
.IR statfs64 .
The new structure contains the same fields as the original
.I statfs
structure, but the sizes of various fields are increased,
to accommodate large file sizes.
The glibc
.BR statfs ()
and
.BR fstatfs ()
wrapper functions transparently deal with the kernel differences.

Some systems only have \fI<sys/vfs.h>\fP, other systems also have
\fI<sys/statfs.h>\fP, where the former includes the latter.
So it seems
including the former is the best choice.

LSB has deprecated the library calls
.BR statfs ()
and
.BR fstatfs ()
and tells us to use
.BR statvfs (2)
and
.BR fstatvfs (2)
instead.
.SS The f_fsid field
Solaris, Irix and POSIX have a system call
.BR statvfs (2)
that returns a
.I "struct statvfs"
(defined in
.IR <sys/statvfs.h> )
containing an
.I "unsigned long"
.IR f_fsid .
Linux, SunOS, HP-UX, 4.4BSD have a system call
.BR statfs ()
that returns a
.I "struct statfs"
(defined in
.IR <sys/vfs.h> )
containing a
.I fsid_t
.IR f_fsid ,
where
.I fsid_t
is defined as
.IR "struct { int val[2]; }" .
The same holds for FreeBSD, except that it uses the include file
.IR <sys/mount.h> .

The general idea is that
.I f_fsid
contains some random stuff such that the pair
.RI ( f_fsid , ino )
uniquely determines a file.
Some operating systems use (a variation on) the device number, or the device number
combined with the filesystem type.
Several OSes restrict giving out the
.I f_fsid
field to the superuser only (and zero it for unprivileged users),
because this field is used in the filehandle of the filesystem
when NFS-exported, and giving it out is a security concern.
.LP
Under some operating systems the
.I fsid
can be used as second argument to the
.BR sysfs (2)
system call.
