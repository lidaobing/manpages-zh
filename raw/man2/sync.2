.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sync ()
causes all buffered modifications to file metadata and data to be
written to the underlying filesystems.

.BR syncfs ()
is like
.BR sync (),
but synchronizes just the filesystem containing file
referred to by the open file descriptor
.IR fd .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR syncfs ()
returns 0 on success;
on error, it returns \-1 and sets
.I errno
to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
.BR sync ()
is always successful.

.BR syncfs ()
can fail for at least the following reason:
.TP
.B EBADF
.I fd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR syncfs ()
first appeared in Linux 2.6.39;
library support was added to glibc in version 2.14.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR sync ():
SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

.BR syncfs ()
is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
Since glibc 2.2.2 the Linux prototype for
.BR sync ()
is as listed above,
following the various standards.
In libc4, libc5, and glibc up to 2.2.1
it was "int sync(void)", and
.BR sync ()
always returned 0.
.SH BUGS
According to the standard specification (e.g., POSIX.1-2001),
.BR sync ()
schedules the writes, but may return before the actual
writing is done.
However, since version 1.3.20 Linux does actually wait.
(This still does not guarantee data integrity: modern disks have
large caches.)
