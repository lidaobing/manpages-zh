.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fchownat ()
system call operates in exactly the same way as
.BR chown (2),
except for the differences described in this manual page.

If the pathname given in
.I pathname
is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory
referred to by the file descriptor
.I dirfd
(rather than relative to the current working directory of
the calling process, as is done by
.BR chown (2)
for a relative pathname).

If
.I pathname
is relative and
.I dirfd
is the special value
.BR AT_FDCWD ,
then
.I pathname
is interpreted relative to the current working
directory of the calling process (like
.BR chown (2)).

If
.I pathname
is absolute, then
.I dirfd
is ignored.

The
.I flags
argument is a bit mask created by ORing together
0 or more of the following values;
.TP
.BR AT_EMPTY_PATH " (since Linux 2.6.39)"
.\" commit 65cfc6722361570bfe255698d9cd4dccaf47570d
If
.I pathname
is an empty string, operate on the file referred to by
.IR dirfd
(which may have been obtained using the
.BR open (2)
.B O_PATH
flag).
In this case,
.I dirfd
can refer to any type of file, not just a directory.

.TP
.B AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
If
.I pathname
is a symbolic link, do not dereference it:
instead operate on the link itself, like
.BR lchown (2).
(By default,
.BR fchownat ()
dereferences symbolic links, like
.BR chown (2).)
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR fchownat ()
returns 0.
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
The same errors that occur for
.BR chown (2)
can also occur for
.BR fchownat ().
The following additional errors can occur for
.BR fchownat ():
.TP
.B EBADF
.I dirfd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid flag specified in
.IR flags .
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
.I pathname
is relative and
.I dirfd
is a file descriptor referring to a file other than a directory.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR fchownat ()
was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16;
library support was added to glibc in version 2.4.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008.
A similar system call exists on Solaris.
.SH NOTES
See
.BR openat (2)
for an explanation of the need for
.BR fchownat ().
