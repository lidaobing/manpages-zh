.SH NAME
getuid, geteuid \- get user identity
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.br
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.sp
.B uid_t getuid(void);
.br
.B uid_t geteuid(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR getuid ()
returns the real user ID of the calling process.

.BR geteuid ()
returns the effective user ID of the calling process.
.SH ERRORS
These functions are always successful.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
.SS History
In UNIX V6 the
.BR getuid ()
call returned
.IR "(euid << 8) + uid" .
UNIX V7 introduced separate calls
.BR getuid ()
and
.BR geteuid ().

The original Linux
.BR getuid ()
and
.BR geteuid ()
system calls supported only 16-bit user IDs.
Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added
.BR getuid32 ()
and
.BR geteuid32 (),
supporting 32-bit IDs.
The glibc
.BR getuid ()
and
.BR geteuid ()
wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.
