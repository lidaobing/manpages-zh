.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.BR sigpending ()
returns the set of signals that are pending for delivery to the calling
thread (i.e., the signals which have been raised while blocked).
The mask of pending signals is returned in
.IR set .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR sigpending ()
returns 0 on success and \-1 on error.
In the event of an error,
.I errno
is set to indicate the cause.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I set
points to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
See
.BR sigsetops (3)
for details on manipulating signal sets.

The set of signals that is pending for a thread
is the union of the set of signals that is pending for that thread
and the set of signals that is pending for the process as a whole; see
.BR signal (7).

A child created via
.BR fork (2)
initially has an empty pending signal set;
the pending signal set is preserved across an
.BR execve (2).
.SH BUGS
In versions of glibc up to and including 2.2.1,
there is a bug in the wrapper function for
.BR sigpending ()
which means that information about pending real-time signals
is not correctly returned.
