.TH GETSOCKNAME 2 2008-12-03 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getsockname \- get socket name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.sp
.BI "int getsockname(int " sockfd ", struct sockaddr *" addr \
", socklen_t *" addrlen );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR getsockname ()
returns the current address to which the socket
.I sockfd
is bound, in the buffer pointed to by
.IR addr .
The
.I addrlen
argument should be initialized to indicate
the amount of space (in bytes) pointed to by
.IR addr .
On return it contains the actual size of the socket address.

The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too small;
in this case,
.I addrlen
will return a value greater than was supplied to the call.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
The argument
.I sockfd
is not a valid descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
The
.I addr
argument points to memory not in a valid part of the
process address space.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I addrlen
is invalid (e.g., is negative).
.TP
.B ENOBUFS
Insufficient resources were available in the system
to perform the operation.
.TP
.B ENOTSOCK
The argument
.I sockfd
is a file, not a socket.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
.BR getsockname ()
function call appeared in 4.2BSD), POSIX.1-2001.
.\" SVr4 documents additional ENOMEM
.\" and ENOSR error codes.
.SH NOTES
The third argument of
.BR getsockname ()
is in reality an
.I "int\ *"
(and this is what 4.x BSD and libc4 and libc5 have).
Some POSIX confusion resulted in the present
.IR socklen_t ,
also used by glibc.

.BR accept (2).
