.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sendfile ()
copies data between one file descriptor and another.
Because this copying is done within the kernel,
.BR sendfile ()
is more efficient than the combination of
.BR read (2)
and
.BR write (2),
which would require transferring data to and from user space.

.I in_fd
should be a file descriptor opened for reading and
.I out_fd
should be a descriptor opened for writing.

If
.I offset
is not NULL, then it points
to a variable holding the file offset from which
.BR sendfile ()
will start reading data from
.IR in_fd .
When
.BR sendfile ()
returns, this variable
will be set to the offset of the byte following the last byte that was read.
If
.I offset
is not NULL, then
.BR sendfile ()
does not modify the current file offset of
.IR in_fd ;
otherwise the current file offset is adjusted to reflect
the number of bytes read from
.IR in_fd .

If
.I offset
is NULL, then data will be read from
.IR in_fd
starting at the current file offset,
and the file offset will be updated by the call.

.I count
is the number of bytes to copy between the file descriptors.

The
.IR in_fd
argument must correspond to a file which supports
.BR mmap (2)-like
operations
(i.e., it cannot be a socket).

In Linux kernels before 2.6.33,
.I out_fd
must refer to a socket.
Since Linux 2.6.33 it can be any file.
If it is a regular file, then
.BR sendfile ()
changes the file offset appropriately.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the transfer was successful, the number of bytes written to
.I out_fd
is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EAGAIN
Nonblocking I/O has been selected using
.B O_NONBLOCK
and the write would block.
.TP
.B EBADF
The input file was not opened for reading or the output file
was not opened for writing.
.TP
.B EFAULT
Bad address.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Descriptor is not valid or locked, or an
.BR mmap (2)-like
operation is not available for
.IR in_fd .
.TP
.B EIO
Unspecified error while reading from
.IR in_fd .
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory to read from
.IR in_fd .
.SH VERSIONS
.BR sendfile ()
is a new feature in Linux 2.2.
The include file
.I <sys/sendfile.h>
is present since glibc 2.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Not specified in POSIX.1-2001, or other standards.

Other UNIX systems implement
.BR sendfile ()
with different semantics and prototypes.
It should not be used in portable programs.
.SH NOTES
If you plan to use
.BR sendfile ()
for sending files to a TCP socket, but need
to send some header data in front of the file contents, you will find
it useful to employ the
.B TCP_CORK
option, described in
.BR tcp (7),
to minimize the number of packets and to tune performance.

In Linux 2.4 and earlier,
.I out_fd
could also refer to a regular file, and
.BR sendfile ()
changed the current offset of that file.

The original Linux
.BR sendfile ()
system call was not designed to handle large file offsets.
Consequently, Linux 2.4 added
.BR sendfile64 (),
with a wider type for the
.I offset
argument.
The glibc
.BR sendfile ()
wrapper function transparently deals with the kernel differences.

Applications may wish to fall back to
.BR read (2)/ write (2)
in the case where
.BR sendfile ()
fails with
.B EINVAL
or
.BR ENOSYS .

The Linux-specific
.BR splice (2)
call supports transferring data between arbitrary files
(e.g., a pair of sockets).
