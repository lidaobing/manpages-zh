.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR symlink ()
creates a symbolic link named
.I linkpath
which contains the string
.IR filepath .

Symbolic links are interpreted at run time as if the contents of the
link had been substituted into the path being followed to find a file or
directory.

Symbolic links may contain
.I ..
path components, which (if used at the start of the link) refer to the
parent directories of that in which the link resides.

A symbolic link (also known as a soft link) may point to an existing
file or to a nonexistent one; the latter case is known as a dangling
link.

The permissions of a symbolic link are irrelevant; the ownership is
ignored when following the link, but is checked when removal or
renaming of the link is requested and the link is in a directory with
the sticky bit
.RB ( S_ISVTX )
set.

If
.I linkpath
exists it will
.I not
be overwritten.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
Write access to the directory containing
.I linkpath
is denied, or one of the directories in the path prefix of
.I linkpath
did not allow search permission.
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EDQUOT
The user's quota of resources on the filesystem has been exhausted.
The resources could be inodes or disk blocks, depending on the filesystem
implementation.
.TP
.B EEXIST
.I linkpath
already exists.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.IR filepath " or " linkpath " points outside your accessible address space."
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred.
.TP
.B ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in resolving
.IR linkpath .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.IR filepath " or " linkpath " was too long."
.TP
.B ENOENT
A directory component in
.I linkpath
does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link, or
.I filepath
is the empty string.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
The device containing the file has no room for the new directory
entry.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component used as a directory in
.I linkpath
is not, in fact, a directory.
.TP
.B EPERM
The filesystem containing
.I linkpath
does not support the creation of symbolic links.
.TP
.B EROFS
.I linkpath
is on a read-only filesystem.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" SVr4 documents additional error codes EDQUOT and ENOSYS.
.\" See
.\" .BR open (2)
.\" re multiple files with the same name, and NFS.
.SH NOTES
No checking of
.I filepath
is done.

Deleting the name referred to by a symlink will actually delete the
file (unless it also has other hard links).
If this behavior is not desired, use
.BR link (2).
