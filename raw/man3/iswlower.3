.TH ISWLOWER 3  1999-07-25 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
iswlower \- test for lowercase wide character
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wctype.h>
.sp
.BI "int iswlower(wint_t " wc );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR iswlower ()
function is the wide-character equivalent of the
.BR islower (3)
function.
It tests whether
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "lower".
.PP
The wide-character class "lower" is a subclass of the wide-character class
"alpha", and therefore also a subclass
of the wide-character class "alnum", of
the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print",
the wide-character class
"lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class "cntrl".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph",
the wide-character class "lower" is disjoint from the
wide-character class "space" and its subclass "blank".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum",
the wide-character class
"lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class "punct".
.PP
Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha",
the wide-character class
"lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class "digit".
.PP
The wide-character class "lower" contains at least
those characters
.I wc
which are equal to
.I towlower(wc)
and different from
.IR towupper(wc) .
.PP
The wide-character class "lower" always contains
at least the letters \(aqa\(aq to \(aqz\(aq.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR iswlower ()
function returns nonzero
if
.I wc
is a wide character
belonging to the wide-character class "lower".
Otherwise it returns zero.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR iswlower ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function is not very appropriate for dealing with Unicode characters,
because Unicode knows about three cases: upper, lower and title case.
