.SH NAME
wctob \- try to represent a wide character as a single byte
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <wchar.h>
.sp
.BI "int wctob(wint_t " c );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR wctob ()
function tests whether
the multibyte representation of the
wide character
.IR c ,
starting in the initial state, consists of a single
byte.
If so, it is returned as an
.IR "unsigned char" .
.PP
Never use this function.
It cannot help you in writing internationalized
programs.
Internationalized programs must never distinguish single-byte and
multibyte characters.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR wctob ()
function returns the single-byte representation of
.IR c ,
if it exists, of
.B EOF
otherwise.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.BR wctob ()
depends on the
.B LC_CTYPE
category of the
current locale.
.PP
This function should never be used.
Internationalized programs must never
distinguish single-byte and multibyte characters.
Use either
.BR wctomb (3)
or the thread-safe
.BR wcrtomb (3)
instead.
