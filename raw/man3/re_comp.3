.TH RE_COMP 3 2013-06-21 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
re_comp, re_exec \- BSD regex functions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #define _REGEX_RE_COMP
.br
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.br
.B #include <regex.h>
.sp
.BI "char *re_comp(char *" regex );
.sp
.BI "int re_exec(char *" string );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR re_comp ()
is used to compile the null-terminated regular expression pointed to by
.IR regex .
The compiled pattern occupies a static area, the pattern buffer,
which is overwritten by subsequent use of
.BR re_comp ().
If
.I regex
is NULL,
no operation is performed and the pattern buffer's contents are not
altered.

.BR re_exec ()
is used to assess whether the null-terminated string pointed to by
.I string
matches the previously compiled
.IR regex .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR re_comp ()
returns NULL on successful compilation of
.I regex
otherwise it returns a pointer to an appropriate error message.

.BR re_exec ()
returns 1 for a successful match, zero for failure.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR re_comp ()
and
.BR re_exec ()
functions are not thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES

.BR regcomp (3)
should be used instead.
