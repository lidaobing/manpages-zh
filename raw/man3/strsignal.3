.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strsignal ()
function returns a string describing the signal
number passed in the argument
.IR sig .
The string can be used only until the next call to
.BR strsignal ().
.PP
The array
.I sys_siglist
holds the signal description strings
indexed by signal number.
The
.BR strsignal ()
function should be
used if possible instead of this array.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR strsignal ()
function returns the appropriate description
string, or an unknown signal message if the signal number is invalid.
On some systems (but not on Linux), a NULL pointer may be
returned instead for an invalid signal number.
