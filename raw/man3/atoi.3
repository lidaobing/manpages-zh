.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR atoi ()
function converts the initial portion of the string
pointed to by \fInptr\fP to
.IR int .
The behavior is the same as
.sp
.in +4n
strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);
.in
.sp
except that
.BR atoi ()
does not detect errors.
.PP
The
.BR atol ()
and
.BR atoll ()
functions behave the same as
.BR atoi (),
except that they convert the initial portion of the
string to their return type of \fIlong\fP or \fIlong long\fP.
.BR atoq ()
is an obsolete name for
.BR atoll ().
.SH RETURN VALUE
The converted value.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR atoi (),
.BR atol (),
and
.BR atoll ()
functions are thread-safe with exceptions.
These functions can be safely used in multithreaded applications,
as long as
.BR setlocale (3)
is not called to change the locale.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C99.
C89 and
POSIX.1-1996 include the functions
.BR atoi ()
and
.BR atol ()
only.
.BR atoq ()
is a GNU extension.
.SH NOTES
The nonstandard
.BR atoq ()
function is not present in libc 4.6.27
or glibc 2, but is present in libc5 and libc 4.7 (though only as an
inline function in \fI<stdlib.h>\fP until libc 5.4.44).
The
.BR atoll ()
function is present in glibc 2 since version 2.0.2, but
not in libc4 or libc5.

.BR strtod (3),
