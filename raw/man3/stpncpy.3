.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR stpncpy ()
function copies at most
.I n
characters from the string
pointed to by
.IR src ,
including the terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq),
to the array pointed to by
.IR dest .
Exactly
.I n
characters are written at
.IR dest .
If the length
.I strlen(src)
is smaller than
.IR n ,
the
remaining characters in the array pointed to by
.I dest
are filled
with null bytes (\(aq\\0\(aq),
If the length
.I strlen(src)
is greater or equal to
.IR n ,
the string pointed to by
.I dest
will
not be null-terminated.
.PP
The strings may not overlap.
.PP
The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least
.I n
characters
at
.IR dest .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR stpncpy ()
returns a pointer to the terminating null byte
in
.IR dest ,
or, if
.I dest
is not null-terminated,
.IR dest + n .
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function was added to POSIX.1-2008.
Before that, it was a GNU extension.
