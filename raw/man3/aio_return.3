.B "#include <aio.h>"
.sp
.BI "ssize_t aio_return(struct aiocb *" aiocbp );
.sp
Link with \fI\-lrt\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR aio_return ()
function returns the final return status for the asynchronous I/O request
with control block pointed to by
.IR aiocbp .
(See
.BR aio (7)
for a description of the
.I aiocb
structure.)
.LP
This function should be called only once for any given request, after
.BR aio_error (3)
returns something other than
.BR EINPROGRESS .
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the asynchronous I/O operation has completed, this function returns
the value that would have been returned in case of a synchronous
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR fsync (2)
or
.BR fdatasync (2),
call.

If the asynchronous I/O operation has not yet completed,
the return value and effect of
.BR aio_return ()
are undefined.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I aiocbp
does not point at a control block for an asynchronous I/O request
of which the return status has not been retrieved yet.
