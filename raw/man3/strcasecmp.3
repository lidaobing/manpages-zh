.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strcasecmp ()
function compares the two strings
.I s1
and
.IR s2 ,

less than, equal to, or greater than zero if

is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than
.IR s2 .

The
.BR strncasecmp ()
function is similar, except it compares
the only first
.I n
bytes of
.IR s1 .
.SH RETURN VALUE

and
.BR strncasecmp ()
