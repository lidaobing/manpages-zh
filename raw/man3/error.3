.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR error ()
is a general error-reporting function.
It flushes
.IR stdout ,
and then outputs to
.I stderr
the program name, a colon and a space, the message specified by the
.BR printf (3)-style
format string \fIformat\fP, and, if \fIerrnum\fP is
nonzero, a second colon and a space followed by the string given by
.IR strerror(errnum) .
Any arguments required for
.I format
should follow
.I format
in the argument list.
The output is terminated by a newline character.

The program name printed by
.BR error ()
is the value of the global variable
.BR program_invocation_name (3).
.I program_invocation_name
initially has the same value as
.IR main ()'s
.IR argv[0] .
The value of this variable can be modified to change the output of
.BR error ().

If \fIstatus\fP has a nonzero value, then
.BR error ()
calls
.BR exit (3)
to terminate the program using the given value as the exit status.

The
.BR error_at_line ()
function is exactly the same as
.BR error (),
except for the addition of the arguments
.I filename
and
.IR linenum .
The output produced is as for
.BR error (),
except that after the program name are written: a colon, the value of
.IR filename ,
a colon, and the value of
.IR linenum .
The preprocessor values \fB__LINE__\fP and
\fB__FILE__\fP may be useful when calling
.BR error_at_line (),
but other values can also be used.
For example, these arguments could refer to a location in an input file.

If the global variable \fIerror_one_per_line\fP is set nonzero,
a sequence of
.BR error_at_line ()
calls with the
same value of \fIfilename\fP and \fIlinenum\fP will result in only
one message (the first) being output.

The global variable \fIerror_message_count\fP counts the number of
messages that have been output by
.BR error ()
and
.BR error_at_line ().

If the global variable \fIerror_print_progname\fP
is assigned the address of a function
(i.e., is not NULL), then that function is called
instead of prefixing the message with the program name and colon.
The function should print a suitable string to
.IR stderr .
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions and variables are GNU extensions, and should not be
used in programs intended to be portable.
