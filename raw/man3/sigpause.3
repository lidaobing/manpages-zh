.TH SIGPAUSE 3 2010-09-12 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigpause \- atomically release blocked signals and wait for interrupt
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigpause(int " sigmask ");  /* BSD */"
.sp
.BI "int sigpause(int " sig ");      /* System V / UNIX 95 */"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Don't use this function.
Use
.BR sigsuspend (2)
instead.
.LP
The function
.BR sigpause ()
is designed to wait for some signal.
It changes the process's signal mask (set of blocked signals),
and then waits for a signal to arrive.
Upon arrival of a signal, the original signal mask is restored.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If
.BR sigpause ()
returns, it was interrupted by a signal and the return value is \-1
with
.I errno
set to
.BR EINTR .
.SH CONFORMING TO
The System V version of
.BR sigpause ()
is standardized in POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
.SS History
The classical BSD version of this function appeared in 4.2BSD.
It sets the process's signal mask to
.IR sigmask .
UNIX 95 standardized the incompatible System V version of
this function, which removes only the specified signal
.I sig
from the process's signal mask.
.\" __xpg_sigpause: UNIX 95, spec 1170, SVID, SVr4, XPG
The unfortunate situation with two incompatible functions with the
same name was solved by the
.BR \%sigsuspend (2)
function, that takes a
.I "sigset_t\ *"
argument (instead of an
.IR int ).
.SS Linux notes
On Linux, this routine is a system call only on the Sparc (sparc64)
architecture.

Libc4 and libc5 know only about the BSD version.

Glibc uses the BSD version if the
.B _BSD_SOURCE
feature test macro is defined and none of
.BR _POSIX_SOURCE ,
.BR _POSIX_C_SOURCE ,
.BR _XOPEN_SOURCE ,
.BR _GNU_SOURCE ,
or
.B _SVID_SOURCE
is defined.
Otherwise, the System V version is used.
.\"
.\" For the BSD version, one usually uses a zero
.\" .I sigmask
.\" to indicate that no signals are to be blocked.
