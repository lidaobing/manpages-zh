.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR getdtablesize ()
returns the maximum number of files a process can have open,
one more than the largest possible value for a file descriptor.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The current limit on the number of open files per process.
.SH ERRORS
On Linux,
.BR getdtablesize ()
can return any of the errors described for
.BR getrlimit (2);
see NOTES below.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.4BSD (the
.BR getdtablesize ()
function first appeared in 4.2BSD).
It is not specified in POSIX.1-2001;
portable applications should employ
.I sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)
instead of this call.
.SH NOTES
.BR getdtablesize ()
is implemented as a libc library function.
The glibc version calls
.BR getrlimit (2)
and returns the current
.B RLIMIT_NOFILE
limit, or
.B OPEN_MAX
when that fails.
The libc4 and libc5 versions return
.B OPEN_MAX
(set to 256 since Linux 0.98.4).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR close (2),
.BR dup (2),
.BR getrlimit (2),
.BR open (2)
