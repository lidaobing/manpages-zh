.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memfrob ()
function encrypts the first \fIn\fP bytes of the

42.
The effect can be reversed by using
.BR memfrob ()
on the
encrypted memory area.

Note that this function is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
constant is fixed, and is suitable only for hiding strings.

The
.BR memfrob ()
function returns a pointer to the encrypted memory
area.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The
.BR memfrob ()
function is unique to the
GNU C Library.
