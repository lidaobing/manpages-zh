.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <strings.h>
.sp
.BI "int bcmp(const void *" s1 ", const void *" s2 ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR bcmp ()
function compares the two byte sequences
.I s1
and
.I s2
of length
.I n
each.
If they are equal, and in particular if
.I n
is zero,
.BR bcmp ()
returns 0.
Otherwise it returns a nonzero result.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR bcmp ()
function returns 0 if the byte sequences are equal,
otherwise a nonzero result is returned.
