.TH STRXFRM 3  2012-05-10 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strxfrm \- string transformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t strxfrm(char *" dest ", const char *" src ", size_t " n );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR strxfrm ()
function transforms the
.I src
string into a
form such that the result of
.BR strcmp (3)
on two strings that have
been transformed with
.BR strxfrm ()
is the same as the result of
.BR strcoll (3)
on the two strings before their transformation.
The first
.I n
bytes of the transformed string are placed in
.IR dest .
The transformation is based on the program's current
locale for category
.BR LC_COLLATE .
(See
.BR setlocale (3)).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR strxfrm ()
function returns the number of bytes required to
store the transformed string in
.I dest
excluding the
terminating null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq).
If the value returned is
.I n
or more, the
contents of
.I dest
are indeterminate.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
.SH NOTES
In the
.IR POSIX
or
.IR C
locales
.BR strxfrm ()
is equivalent to
copying the string with
.BR strncpy (3).
