.SH DESCRIPTION
.I expm1(x)
returns a value equivalent to
.nf

    exp(x) \- 1

.fi
It is
computed in a way that is accurate even if the value of
.I x
is near
zero\(ema case where
.I "exp(x) \- 1"
would be inaccurate due to
subtraction of two numbers that are nearly equal.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return
.IR "exp(x)\ \-\ 1" .

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is +0 (\-0),
+0 (\-0) is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

If
.I x
is negative infinity, \-1 is returned.

If the result overflows, a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.RB - HUGE_VAL ,
.RB - HUGE_VALF ,
or
.RB - HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error, overflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE
(but see BUGS).
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.\"
.\" POSIX.1 specifies an optional range error (underflow) if
.\" x is subnormal.  Glibc does not implement this.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR expm1 (),
.BR expm1f (),
and
.BR expm1l ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" BSD.
.SH BUGS
For some large negative
.I x
values (where the function result approaches \-1),
.BR expm1 ()
raises a bogus underflow floating-point exception.
.\" FIXME .
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6778

For some large positive
.I x
values,
.BR expm1 ()
raises a bogus invalid floating-point exception in addition to the expected
overflow exception, and returns a NaN instead of positive infinity.
.\" FIXME .
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6814
.\" e.g., expm1(1e5) through expm1(1.00199970127e5),
.\" but not expm1(1.00199970128e5) and beyond.

Before version 2.11,
.\" It looks like the fix was in 2.11, or possibly 2.12.
.\" I have no test system for 2.11, but 2.12 passes.
.\" From the source (sysdeps/i386/fpu/s_expm1.S) it looks
.\" like the changes were in 2.11.
the glibc implementation did not set
.\" http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6788
.I errno
to
.B ERANGE
when a range error occurred.
