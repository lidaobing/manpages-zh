.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.br
.B #include <math.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR exp10 ()
function returns the value of 10
raised to the power of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the base-10 exponential value of
.IR x .

For various special cases, including the handling of infinity and NaN,
as well as overflows and underflows, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.

For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions, see
.BR exp (3).
.\" FIXME . exp10 doesn't give ERANGE for an underflow, unlike exp() and exp2()
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6787
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are GNU extensions.
