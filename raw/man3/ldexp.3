.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ldexp ()
function returns the result of multiplying the floating-point number
.I x
by 2 raised to the power
.IR exp .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return
.IR "x * (2^exp)" .

If
.I exp
is zero, then
.I x
is returned.

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity (negative infinity),
positive infinity (negative infinity) is returned.

If the result underflows,
a range error occurs,
and zero is returned.

If the result overflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.BR HUGE_VAL ,
.BR HUGE_VALF ,
or
.BR HUGE_VALL ,
respectively, with a sign the same as
.IR x .
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error, overflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.TP
Range error, underflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An underflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_UNDERFLOW )
is raised.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR ldexp (),
.BR ldexpf (),
and
.BR ldexpl ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
