.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR getw ()
reads a word (that is, an \fIint\fP) from \fIstream\fP.
It's provided for compatibility with SVr4.
We recommend you use
.BR fread (3)
instead.
.P
.BR putw ()
writes the word \fIw\fP (that is,
an \fIint\fP) to \fIstream\fP.
It is provided for compatibility with SVr4, but we recommend you use
.BR fwrite (3)
instead.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Normally,
.BR getw ()
returns the word read, and
.BR putw ()
returns 0.
On error, they return \fBEOF\fP.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, SUSv2.  Not present in POSIX.1-2001.
.SH BUGS
The value returned on error is also a legitimate data value.
.BR ferror (3)
can be used to distinguish between the two cases.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR ferror (3),
.BR fread (3),
.BR fwrite (3),
.BR getc (3),
.BR putc (3)
