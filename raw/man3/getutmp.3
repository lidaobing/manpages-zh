.TH GETUTMP 3 2010-09-10 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getutmp, getutmpx \- copy utmp structure to utmpx, and vice versa
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.B #include <utmpx.h>

.BI " void getutmp(const struct utmpx *" ux ", struct utmp *" u );
.BI " void getutmpx(const struct utmp *" u ", struct utmpx *" ux );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR getutmp ()
function copies the fields of the
.I utmpx
structure pointed to by
.I ux
to the corresponding fields of the
.I utmp
structure pointed to by
.IR u .
The
.BR getutmpx ()
function performs the converse operation.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions do not return a value.
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are nonstandard, but appear on a few other systems,
such as Solaris and NetBSD.
.SH NOTES
These functions exist primarily for compatibility with other
systems where the
.I utmp
and
.I utmpx
structures contain different fields,
or the size of corresponding fields differs.
.\" e.g., on Solaris, the utmpx structure is rather larger than utmp.
On Linux, the two structures contain the same fields,
and the fields have the same sizes.
