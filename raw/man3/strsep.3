.TH STRSEP 3  2011-09-28 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strsep \- extract token from string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "char *strsep(char **" stringp ", const char *" delim );
.fi
.sp
.in -4n
Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
.in
.sp
.BR strsep ():
_BSD_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.I *stringp
is NULL, the
.BR strsep ()
function returns NULL
and does nothing else.
Otherwise, this function finds the first token
in the string
.IR *stringp ,
where tokens
are delimited by symbols in the string
.IR delim .
This token is terminated by overwriting the delimiter
with a null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq)
and
.I *stringp
is updated to point past the token.
In case no delimiter was found, the token is taken to be
the entire string
.IR *stringp ,
and
.I *stringp
is made NULL.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR strsep ()
function returns a pointer to the token,
that is, it returns the original value of
.IR *stringp .
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.4BSD.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR strsep ()
function was introduced as a replacement for
.BR strtok (3),
since the latter cannot handle empty fields.
However,
.BR strtok (3)
conforms to C89/C99 and hence is more portable.
.SH BUGS
Be cautious when using this function.
If you do use it, note that:
.IP * 2
This function modifies its first argument.
.IP *
This function cannot be used on constant strings.
.IP *
The identity of the delimiting character is lost.
