.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR copysign (),
.BR copysignf (),
and
.BR copysignl ()
functions return a value whose absolute value matches
that of
.IR x ,
but whose sign bit matches that of
.IR y .

For example,
.I "copysign(42.0,\ \-1.0)"
and
.I "copysign(\-42.0, \-1.0)"
both return \-42.0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return a value whose magnitude is taken from
.I x
and whose sign is taken from
.IR y .

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN with the sign bit of
.I y
is returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR copysign (),
.BR copysignf (),
and
.BR copysignl ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.\" 4.3BSD.
This function is defined in IEC 559 (and the appendix with
recommended functions in IEEE 754/IEEE 854).
.SH NOTES
On architectures where the floating-point formats are not IEEE 754 compliant,
these
functions may treat a negative zero as positive.
