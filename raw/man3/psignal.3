.BR psignal ():

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR psignal ()
function displays a message on \fIstderr\fP
consisting of the string \fIs\fP, a colon, a space, a string
describing the signal number \fIsig\fP, and a trailing newline.
If the string \fIs\fP is NULL or empty, the colon and space are omitted.
If \fIsig\fP is invalid,
the message displayed will indicate an unknown signal.

The
.BR psiginfo ()
function is like
.BR psignal (),
except that it displays information about the signal described by
.IR pinfo ,
which should point to a valid
.I siginfo_t
structure.
As well as the signal description,
.BR psiginfo ()
displays information about the origin of the signal,
and other information relevant to the signal
(e.g., the relevant memory address for hardware-generated signals,
the child process ID for
.BR SIGCHLD ,
and the user ID and process ID of the sender, for signals set using
.BR kill (2)
or
.BR sigqueue (3)).

The array \fIsys_siglist\fP holds the signal description strings
indexed by signal number.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR psignal ()
and
.BR psiginfo ()
functions return no value.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR psiginfo ()
function was added to glibc in version 2.10.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.
.SH BUGS
In glibc versions up to 2.12,
.BR psiginfo ()
had the following bugs:
.IP * 3
In some circumstances, a trailing newline is not printed.
.\" FIXME http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12107
.\" Reportedly now fixed; check glibc 2.13
.IP *
Additional details are not displayed for real-time signals.
