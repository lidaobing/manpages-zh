.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR dirfd ()
returns the file descriptor associated with the directory stream
.IR dirp .
.LP
This descriptor is the one used internally by the directory stream.
As a result, it is useful only for functions which do not depend on
or alter the file position, such as
.BR fstat (2)
and
.BR fchdir (2).
It will be automatically closed when
.BR closedir (3)
is called.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, a nonnegative file descriptor is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the cause of the error.
.SH ERRORS
POSIX.1-2008 specifies two errors,
neither of which is returned by the current
.\" glibc 2.8
implementation.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I dirp
does not refer to a valid directory stream.
.TP
.B ENOTSUP
The implementation does not support the association of a file
descriptor with a directory.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR dirfd ()
function is thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008.
This function was a BSD extension, present in 4.3BSD-Reno, not in 4.2BSD.
.\" It is present in libc5 (since 5.1.2) and in glibc2.
.SH NOTES
The prototype for
.BR dirfd ()
is available only if
.B _BSD_SOURCE
or
.B _SVID_SOURCE
is defined.
