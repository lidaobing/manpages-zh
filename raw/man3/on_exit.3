.SH NAME
on_exit \- register a function to be called at normal process termination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.BI "int on_exit(void (*" function ")(int , void *), void *" arg );
.fi
.sp
.in -4n

.BR on_exit ():
_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR on_exit ()
function registers the given
.I function
to be
called at normal process termination, whether via
.BR exit (3)
or via return from the program's
.IR main ().
The
.I function
is passed the status argument given to the last call to
.BR exit (3)
and the
.I arg
argument from
.BR on_exit ().

The same function may be registered multiple times:
it is called once for each registration.

When a child process is created via
.BR fork (2),
it inherits copies of its parent's registrations.
Upon a successful call to one of the
.BR exec (3)
functions, all registrations are removed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR on_exit ()
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise
it returns a nonzero value.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function comes from SunOS 4, but is also present in
libc4, libc5 and glibc.
It no longer occurs in Solaris (SunOS 5).
Avoid this function, and use the standard
.BR atexit (3)
instead.
