.SH DESCRIPTION
The routine
.BR perror ()
produces a message on the standard error output, describing the last
error encountered during a call to a system or library function.
First (if
.I s
is not NULL and
.I *s
is not a null byte (\(aq\\0\(aq)) the argument string
.I s
is printed, followed by a colon and a blank.
Then the message and a new-line.

To be of most use, the argument string should include the name
of the function that incurred the error.
The error number is taken from
the external variable
.IR errno ,
which is set when errors occur but not
cleared when successful calls are made.

The global error list
.IR sys_errlist "[]"
indexed by
.I errno
can be used to obtain the error message without the newline.
The largest message number provided in the table is
.IR sys_nerr "\-1."
Be careful when directly accessing this list because new error values
may not have been added to
.IR sys_errlist "[]."
The use of
.IR sys_errlist "[]"
is nowadays deprecated.

When a system call fails, it usually returns \-1 and sets the
variable
.I errno
to a value describing what went wrong.
(These values can be found in
.IR <errno.h> .)
Many library functions do likewise.
The function
.BR perror ()
serves to translate this error code into human-readable form.
Note that
.I errno
is undefined after a successful library call:
this call may well change this variable, even though it succeeds,
for example because it internally used some other library function that failed.
Thus, if a failing call is not immediately followed by a call to
.BR perror (),
the value of
.I errno
should be saved.
.SH CONFORMING TO
The function
.BR perror ()
and the external
.I errno
(see
.BR errno (3))
conform to C89, C99, 4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
The externals
.I sys_nerr
and
.I sys_errlist
conform to BSD.
.SH NOTES
The externals
.I sys_nerr
and
.I sys_errlist
are defined by glibc, but in
.IR <stdio.h> .
.\" and only when _BSD_SOURCE is defined.
.\" When
.\" .B _GNU_SOURCE
.\" is defined, the symbols
.\" .I _sys_nerr
.\" and
.\" .I _sys_errlist
.\" are provided.
