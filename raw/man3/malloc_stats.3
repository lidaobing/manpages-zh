.TH MALLOC_STATS 3  2012-05-06 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
malloc_stats \- print memory allocation statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <malloc.h>

.B void malloc_stats(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR malloc_stats ()
function prints (on standard error) statistics about memory allocated by
.BR malloc (3)
and related functions.
For each arena (allocation area), this function prints
the total amount of memory allocated
and the total number of bytes consumed by in-use allocations.
(These two values correspond to the
.I arena
and
.I uordblks
fields retrieved by
.BR mallinfo (3).)
In addition,
the function prints the sum of these two statistics for all arenas,
and the maximum number of blocks and bytes that were ever simultaneously
allocated using
.BR mmap (2).
.\" .SH VERSIONS
.\" Available already in glibc 2.0, possibly earlier
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH NOTES
More detailed information about memory allocations in the main arena
can be obtained using
.BR mallinfo (3).
