.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_attr_setaffinity_np ()
function
sets the CPU affinity mask attribute of the
thread attributes object referred to by
.I attr
to the value specified in
.IR cpuset .
This attribute determines the CPU affinity mask
of a thread created using the thread attributes object
.IR attr .

The
.BR pthread_attr_getaffinity_np ()
function
returns the CPU affinity mask attribute of the thread attributes object
referred to by
.IR attr
in the buffer pointed to by
.IR cpuset .

The argument
.I cpusetsize
is the length (in bytes) of the buffer pointed to by
.IR cpuset .
Typically, this argument would be specified as
.IR sizeof(cpu_set_t) .

For more details on CPU affinity masks, see
.BR sched_setaffinity (2).
For a description of a set of macros
that can be used to manipulate and inspect CPU sets, see
.BR CPU_SET (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return 0;
on error, they return a nonzero error number.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.BR EINVAL
.RB ( pthread_attr_setaffinity_np ())
.I cpuset
specified a CPU that was outside the set supported by the kernel.
(The kernel configuration option
.BR CONFIG_NR_CPUS
defines the range of the set supported by the kernel data type
.\" cpumask_t
used to represent CPU sets.)
.\" The raw sched_getaffinity() system call returns the size (in bytes)
.\" of the cpumask_t type.
.TP
.B EINVAL
.RB ( pthread_attr_getaffinity_np ())
A CPU in the affinity mask of the thread attributes object referred to by
.I attr
lies outside the range specified by
.IR cpusetsize
(i.e.,
.IR cpuset / cpusetsize
is too small).
.TP
.B ENOMEM
.RB ( pthread_attr_setaffinity_np ())
Could not allocate memory.
.SH VERSIONS
These functions are provided by glibc since version 2.3.4.
.SH CONFORMING TO
These functions are nonstandard GNU extensions;
hence the suffix "_np" (nonportable) in the names.
.SH NOTES
In glibc 2.3.3 only,
versions of these functions were provided that did not have a
.I cpusetsize
argument.
Instead the CPU set size given to the underlying system calls was always
.IR sizeof(cpu_set_t) .
