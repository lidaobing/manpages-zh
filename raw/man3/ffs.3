.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR ffs ()
function returns the position of the first
(least significant) bit set in the word \fIi\fP.
The least significant bit is position 1 and the
most significant position is, for example, 32 or 64.
The functions
.BR ffsll ()
and
.BR ffsl ()
do the same but take
arguments of possibly different size.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return the position of the first bit set,
or 0 if no bits are set in
.IR i .
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR ffs ():
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.

The
.BR ffsl ()
and
.BR ffsll ()
functions are glibc extensions.
.SH NOTES
BSD systems have a prototype in
.IR <string.h> .
