.SH NAME
raise \- send a signal to the caller
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int raise(int " sig );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR raise ()
function sends a signal to the calling process or thread.
In a single-threaded program it is equivalent to
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
kill(getpid(), sig);
.fi
.in
.PP
In a multithreaded program it is equivalent to
.sp
.in +4n
.nf
pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);
.fi
.in
.PP
If the signal causes a handler to be called,
.BR raise ()
will return only after the signal handler has returned.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR raise ()
returns 0 on success, and nonzero for failure.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C89, C99, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
Since version 2.3.3, glibc implements
.BR raise ()
by calling
.BR tgkill (2),
.\" 2.3.2 used the obsolete tkill(), if available.
if the kernel supports that system call.
Older glibc versions implemented
.BR raise ()
using
.BR kill (2).
