.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions return the absolute value of the floating-point
number
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return the absolute value of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is \-0, +0 is returned.

If
.I x
is negative infinity or positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))

.BR fabs (),
.BR fabsf (),
and
.BR fabsl ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
