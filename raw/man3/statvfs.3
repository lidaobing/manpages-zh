.TH STATVFS 3 2013-09-26 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
statvfs, fstatvfs \- get filesystem statistics
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/statvfs.h>
.sp
.BI "int statvfs(const char *" path ", struct statvfs *" buf );
.br
.BI "int fstatvfs(int " fd ", struct statvfs *" buf );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR statvfs ()
returns information about a mounted filesystem.
.I path
is the pathname of any file within the mounted filesystem.
.I buf
is a pointer to a
.I statvfs
structure defined approximately as follows:

.in +4n
.nf
struct statvfs {
    unsigned long  f_bsize;    /* filesystem block size */
    unsigned long  f_frsize;   /* fragment size */
    fsblkcnt_t     f_blocks;   /* size of fs in f_frsize units */
    fsblkcnt_t     f_bfree;    /* # free blocks */
    fsblkcnt_t     f_bavail;   /* # free blocks for unprivileged users */
    fsfilcnt_t     f_files;    /* # inodes */
    fsfilcnt_t     f_ffree;    /* # free inodes */
    fsfilcnt_t     f_favail;   /* # free inodes for unprivileged users */
    unsigned long  f_fsid;     /* filesystem ID */
    unsigned long  f_flag;     /* mount flags */
    unsigned long  f_namemax;  /* maximum filename length */
};
.fi
.in

Here the types
.I fsblkcnt_t
and
.I fsfilcnt_t
are defined in
.IR <sys/types.h> .
Both used to be
.IR "unsigned long" .

The field
.I f_flag
is a bit mask (of mount flags, see
.BR mount (8)).
Bits defined by POSIX are
.TP
.B ST_RDONLY
Read-only filesystem.
.TP
.B ST_NOSUID
Set-user-ID/set-group-ID bits are ignored by
.BR exec (3).
.LP
It is unspecified whether all members of the returned struct
have meaningful values on all filesystems.

.BR fstatvfs ()
returns the same information about an open file referenced by descriptor
.IR fd .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, zero is returned.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EACCES
.RB ( statvfs ())
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix of
.IR path .
(See also
.BR path_resolution (7).)
.TP
.B EBADF
.RB ( fstatvfs ())
.I fd
is not a valid open file descriptor.
.TP
.B EFAULT
.I Buf
or
.I path
points to an invalid address.
.TP
.B EINTR
This call was interrupted by a signal.
.TP
.B EIO
An I/O error occurred while reading from the filesystem.
.TP
.B ELOOP
.RB ( statvfs ())
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating
.IR path .
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.RB ( statvfs ())
.I path
is too long.
.TP
.B ENOENT
.RB ( statvfs ())
The file referred to by
.I path
does not exist.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The filesystem does not support this call.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
.RB ( statvfs ())
A component of the path prefix of
.I path
is not a directory.
.TP
.B EOVERFLOW
Some values were too large to be represented in the returned struct.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR statvfs ()
and
.BR fstatvfs ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The Linux kernel has system calls
.BR statfs (2)
and
.BR fstatfs (2)
to support this library call.

The current glibc implementations of
.sp
.nf
   pathconf(path, _PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN);
   pathconf(path, _PC_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN);
   pathconf(path, _PC_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE);
.fi
.sp
respectively use the
.IR f_frsize ,
.IR f_frsize ,
and
.I f_bsize
fields of the return value of
.IR "statvfs(path,buf)" .
