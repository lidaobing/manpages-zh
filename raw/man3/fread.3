.SH NAME
fread, fwrite \- binary stream input/output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "size_t fread(void *" ptr ", size_t " size ", size_t " nmemb \
", FILE *" stream );
.sp
.BI "size_t fwrite(const void *" ptr ", size_t " size ", size_t " nmemb ,
.BI "              FILE *" stream );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.BR fread ()
reads
.I nmemb
elements of data, each
.I size
bytes long, from the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
storing them at the location given by
.IR ptr .
.PP
The function
.BR fwrite ()
writes
.I nmemb
elements of data, each
.I size
bytes long, to the stream pointed to by
.IR stream ,
obtaining them from the location given by
.IR ptr .
.PP
For nonlocking counterparts, see
.BR unlocked_stdio (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR fread ()
and
.BR fwrite ()
return the number of
.I items
read or written.
This number equals the number of bytes transferred only when
.I size
is 1.
If an error occurs, or the end of the file is reached,
the return value is a short item count (or zero).
.PP
.BR fread ()
does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use
.BR feof (3)
and
.BR ferror (3)
to determine which occurred.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C89, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR read (2),
.BR write (2),
.BR feof (3),
.BR ferror (3),
