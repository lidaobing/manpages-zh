.SH NAME
telldir \- return current location in directory stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <dirent.h>
.sp
.BI "long telldir(DIR *" dirp );
.fi
.sp
.in -4n
Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
.in
.sp
.BR telldir ():
_BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR telldir ()
function returns the current location associated with
the directory stream \fIdirp\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the
.BR telldir ()
function returns the current location
in the directory stream.
On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
Invalid directory stream descriptor \fIdirp\fP.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR telldir ()
function is thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the return type of
.BR telldir ()
was
.IR off_t .
POSIX.1-2001 specifies
.IR long ,
and this is the type used since glibc 2.1.2.

In early filesystems, the value returned by
.BR telldir ()
was a simple file offset within a directory.
Modern filesystems use tree or hash structures, rather than flat tables,
to represent directories.
On such filesystems, the value returned by
.BR telldir ()
(and used internally by
.BR readdir (3))
is a "cookie" that is used by the implementation
to derive a position within a directory.
.\" https://lwn.net/Articles/544298/
Application programs should treat this strictly as an opaque value, making
.I no
assumptions about its contents.
