.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR modf ()
function breaks the argument
.I x
into an integral
part and a fractional part, each of which has the same sign as
.IR x .
The integral part is stored in the location pointed to by
.IR iptr .
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR modf ()
function returns the fractional part of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned, and
.IR *iptr
is set to a NaN.

If
.I x
is positive infinity (negative infinity), +0 (\-0) is returned, and
.IR *iptr
is set to positive infinity (negative infinity).
.SH ERRORS
No errors occur.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR modf (),
.BR modff (),
and
.BR modfl ()
functions are thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
