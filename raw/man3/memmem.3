.SH NAME
memmem \- locate a substring
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BR "#define _GNU_SOURCE" "         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */"
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "void *memmem(const void *" haystack ", size_t " haystacklen ,
.BI "             const void *" needle ", size_t " needlelen  );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR memmem ()
function finds the start of the first occurrence
of the substring
.IR needle
of length
.I needlelen
in the memory
area
.I haystack
of length
.IR haystacklen .
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR memmem ()
function returns a pointer to the beginning of the
substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This function is a GNU extension.
.SH BUGS
This function was broken in Linux libraries up to and including libc 5.0.9;
there the
.IR needle
and
.I haystack
arguments were interchanged,
and a pointer to the end of the first occurrence of
.I needle
was returned.

Both old and new libc's have the bug that if
.I needle
is empty,
.I haystack\-1
(instead of
.IR haystack )
is returned.
And glibc 2.0 makes it worse, returning a pointer to the
last byte of
.IR haystack .
This is fixed in glibc 2.1.
