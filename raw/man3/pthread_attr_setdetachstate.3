.TH PTHREAD_ATTR_SETDETACHSTATE 3 2010-02-03 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pthread_attr_setdetachstate, pthread_attr_getdetachstate \-
set/get detach state attribute in thread attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <pthread.h>

.BI "int pthread_attr_setdetachstate(pthread_attr_t *" attr \
", int " detachstate );
.BI "int pthread_attr_getdetachstate(pthread_attr_t *" attr \
", int *" detachstate );
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_attr_setdetachstate ()
function sets the detach state attribute of the
thread attributes object referred to by
.IR attr
to the value specified in
.IR detachstate .
The detach state attribute determines whether a thread created using
the thread attributes object
.I attr
will be created in a joinable or a detached state.

The following values may be specified in
.IR detachstate :
.TP
.B PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED
Threads that are created using
.I attr
will be created in a detached state.
.TP
.B PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
Threads that are created using
.I attr
will be created in a joinable state.
.PP
The default setting of the detach state attribute in a newly initialized
thread attributes object is
.BR PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE .

The
.BR pthread_attr_getdetachstate ()
returns the detach state attribute of the thread attributes object
.IR attr
in the buffer pointed to by
.IR detachstate .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return 0;
on error, they return a nonzero error number.
.SH ERRORS
.BR pthread_attr_setdetachstate ()
can fail with the following error:
.TP
.B EINVAL
An invalid value was specified in
.IR detachstate .
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
See
.BR pthread_create (3)
for more details on detached and joinable threads.

A thread that is created in a joinable state should
eventually either be joined using
.BR pthread_join (3)
or detached using
.BR pthread_detach (3);
see
.BR pthread_create (3).

It is an error to specify the thread ID of
a thread that was created in a detached state
in a later call to
.BR pthread_detach (3)
or
.BR pthread_join (3).

See
.BR pthread_attr_init (3).
