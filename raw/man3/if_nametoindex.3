The
.BR if_nametoindex ()
function returns the index of the network interface
corresponding to the name

.IR ifindex .
The name is placed in the buffer pointed to by
.IR ifname .
The buffer must allow for the storage of at least
.B IF_NAMESIZE
bytes.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR if_nametoindex ()
returns the index number of the network interface;
on error, 0 is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.

On success,
.BR if_indextoname ()
returns
.IR ifname ;
on error, NULL is returned and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
