.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR exp2 ()
function returns the value of 2
raised to the power of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the base-2 exponential value of
.IR x .

For various special cases, including the handling of infinity and NaN,
as well as overflows and underflows, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.

For a discussion of the errors that can occur for these functions, see
.BR exp (3).
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
