.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR acos ()
function calculates the arc cosine of
.IR x ;
that is
the value whose cosine is
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the arc cosine of
.IR x
in radians; the return value is in the range [0,\ pi].

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is +1,
+0 is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity or negative infinity,
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is outside the range [\-1,\ 1],
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is outside the range [\-1,\ 1]
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
