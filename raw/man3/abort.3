.SH NAME
abort \- cause abnormal process termination
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdlib.h>
.sp
.B void abort(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR abort ()
first unblocks the
.B SIGABRT
signal, and then raises that signal for the calling process.
This results in the abnormal termination of the process unless the
.B SIGABRT
signal is caught and the signal handler does not return
(see
.BR longjmp (3)).
.PP
If the
.BR abort ()
function causes process termination,
all open streams are closed and flushed.
.PP
If the
.B SIGABRT
signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that returns, the
.BR abort ()
function will still terminate the process.
It does this by restoring the default disposition for
.B SIGABRT
and then raising the signal for a second time.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR abort ()
function never returns.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD, C89, C99.
