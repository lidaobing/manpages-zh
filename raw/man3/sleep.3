.SH NAME
sleep \- sleep for the specified number of seconds
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "unsigned int sleep(unsigned int " "seconds" );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR sleep ()
makes the calling thread sleep until
.I seconds
seconds have elapsed or a signal arrives which is not ignored.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Zero if the requested time has elapsed,
or the number of seconds left to sleep,
if the call was interrupted by a signal handler.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH BUGS
.BR sleep ()
may be implemented using
.BR SIGALRM ;
mixing calls to
.BR alarm (2)
and
.BR sleep ()
is a bad idea.
.PP
Using
.BR longjmp (3)
from a signal handler or modifying the handling of
.B SIGALRM
while sleeping will cause undefined results.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR alarm (2),
.BR nanosleep (2),
.BR signal (2),
.BR signal (7)
