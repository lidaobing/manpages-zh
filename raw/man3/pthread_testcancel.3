pthread_testcancel \- request delivery of any pending cancellation request
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <pthread.h>

.B void pthread_testcancel(void);
.sp
Compile and link with \fI\-pthread\fP.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Calling
.BR pthread_testcancel ()
creates a cancellation point within the calling thread,
so that a thread that is otherwise executing code that contains
no cancellation points will respond to a cancellation request.

If cancelability is disabled (using
.BR pthread_setcancelstate (3)),
or no cancellation request is pending,
then a call to
.BR pthread_testcancel ()
has no effect.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function does not return a value.
If the calling thread is canceled as a consequence of a call
to this function, then the function does not return.
.SH ERRORS
This function always succeeds.
.\" SH VERSIONS
.\" Available since glibc 2.0
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.

See
.BR pthread_cleanup_push (3).
