.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR mkdtemp ()
function generates a uniquely named temporary
directory from \fItemplate\fP.
The last six characters of \fItemplate\fP
must be XXXXXX and these are replaced with a string that makes the
directory name unique.
The directory is then created with
permissions 0700.
Since it will be modified,
.I template
must not be a string constant, but should be declared as a character array.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR mkdtemp ()
function returns a pointer to the modified template
string on success, and NULL on failure, in which case
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
The last six characters of \fItemplate\fP were not XXXXXX.
Now \fItemplate\fP is unchanged.
.PP
Also see
.BR mkdir (2)
for other possible values for \fIerrno\fP.
.SH VERSIONS
Available since glibc 2.1.91.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008.
This function is present on the BSDs.
.\" As at 2006, this function is being considered for a revision of POSIX.1
.\" Also in NetBSD 1.4.
