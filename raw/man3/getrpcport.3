.SH DESCRIPTION

returns the port number for version
.I versnum
of the RPC program
.I prognum
running on
.I host
and using protocol
.IR proto .

.I prognum
is not registered.

is registered but not with version
.IR versnum ,
it will still return a port number (for some version of the program)
indicating that the program is indeed registered.
The version mismatch will be detected upon the first call to the service.
