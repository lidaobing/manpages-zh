posix_openpt \- open a pseudoterminal device
.SH SYNOPSIS

.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR posix_openpt ()
function opens an unused pseudoterminal master device, returning a
file descriptor that can be used to refer to that device.

The
.I flags
argument is a bit mask that ORs together zero or more of
the following flags:
.TP
.B O_RDWR
Open the device for both reading and writing.
It is usual to specify this flag.
.TP
.B O_NOCTTY
Do not make this device the controlling terminal for the process.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR posix_openpt ()
returns a nonnegative file descriptor which is the lowest
numbered unused descriptor.
On failure, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR open (2).
.SH VERSIONS
Glibc support for
.BR posix_openpt ()
has been provided since version 2.2.1.
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR posix_openpt ()
is part of the UNIX 98 pseudoterminal support (see
.BR pts (4)).
This function is specified in POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR posix_openpt ()
function is a recent invention in POSIX.
Some UNIX implementations that support System V
(aka UNIX 98) pseudoterminals don't have this function, but it
is easy to implement:
.in +4n
.nf

int
posix_openpt(int flags)
{
    return open("/dev/ptmx", flags);
}
.fi
.in
.PP
Calling
.BR posix_openpt ()
creates a pathname for the corresponding pseudoterminal slave device.
The pathname of the slave device can be obtained using
.BR ptsname (3).
The slave device pathname exists only as long as the master device is open.
