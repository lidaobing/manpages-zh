.SH NAME
ctermid \- get controlling terminal name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.\" POSIX also requires this function to be declared in <unistd.h>,
.\" and glibc does so if suitable feature test macros are defined.
.sp
.BI "char *ctermid(char *" "s" );

Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
.BR feature_test_macros (7)):
.in
.sp
.BR ctermid ():
_POSIX_C_SOURCE\ >=\ 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE
.\" From <unistd.h>: _XOPEN_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR ctermid ()
returns a string which is the pathname for the current
controlling terminal for this process.
If
.I s
is NULL,
a static buffer is used, otherwise
.I s
points to a buffer used to hold the terminal pathname.
The symbolic constant
.B L_ctermid
is the maximum number of characters in the returned pathname.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The pointer to the pathname.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR ctermid ()
function is thread-safe with exceptions.
It is not thread-safe if called with a NULL parameter.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Svr4, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH BUGS
The path returned may not uniquely identify the controlling
terminal; it may, for example, be
.IR /dev/tty .
.PP
It is not assured that the program can open the terminal.
.\" in glibc 2.3.x, x >= 4, the glibc headers threw an error
.\" if ctermid() was given an argument; fixed in 2.4.
