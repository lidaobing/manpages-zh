.TH PTHREAD_SIGMASK 3 2012-08-03 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
pthread_sigmask \- examine and change mask of blocked signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <signal.h>

.BI "int pthread_sigmask(int " how ", const sigset_t *" set \
", sigset_t *" oldset );
.fi
.sp
Compile and link with \fI\-pthread\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_sigmask ()
function is just like
.BR sigprocmask (2),
with the difference that its use in multithreaded programs
is explicitly specified by POSIX.1-2001.
Other differences are noted in this page.

For a description of the arguments and operation of this function, see
.BR sigprocmask (2).
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success,
.BR pthread_sigmask ()
returns 0;
on error, it returns an error number.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR sigprocmask (2).
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
A new thread inherits a copy of its creator's signal mask.
.SH EXAMPLE
The program below blocks some signals in the main thread,
and then creates a dedicated thread to fetch those signals via
.BR sigwait (3).
The following shell session demonstrates its use:

.in +4n
.nf
.RB "$" " ./a.out &"
[1] 5423
.RB "$" " kill \-QUIT %1"
Signal handling thread got signal 3
.RB "$" " kill \-USR1 %1"
Signal handling thread got signal 10
.RB "$" " kill \-TERM %1"
[1]+  Terminated              ./a.out
.fi
