.SH NAME
pthread_attr_setschedpolicy, pthread_attr_getschedpolicy \- set/get
scheduling policy attribute in thread attributes object
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR pthread_attr_setschedpolicy ()
function sets the scheduling policy attribute of the
thread attributes object referred to by
.IR attr
to the value specified in
.IR policy .
This attribute determines the scheduling policy of
a thread created using the thread attributes object
.IR attr .

The supported values for
.I policy
are
.BR SCHED_FIFO ,
.BR SCHED_RR ,
and
.BR SCHED_OTHER ,
with the semantics described in
.BR sched_setscheduler (2).
.\" FIXME . pthread_setschedparam() places no restriction on the policy,
.\" but pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() restricts policy to RR/FIFO/OTHER
.\" http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=7013

The
.BR pthread_attr_getschedpolicy ()
returns the scheduling policy attribute of the thread attributes object
.IR attr
in the buffer pointed to by
.IR policy .

In order for the policy setting made by
.BR pthread_attr_setschedpolicy ()
to have effect when calling
.BR pthread_create (3),
the caller must use
.BR pthread_attr_setinheritsched (3)
to set the inherit-scheduler attribute of the attributes object
.I attr
to
.BR PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return 0;
on error, they return a nonzero error number.
.SH ERRORS
.BR pthread_attr_setschedpolicy ()
can fail with the following error:
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid value in
.IR policy .
.PP
POSIX.1-2001 also documents an optional
.B ENOTSUP
error ("attempt was made to set the attribute to an unsupported value") for
.BR pthread_attr_setschedpolicy ().
.\" .SH VERSIONS
.\" Available since glibc 2.0.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.

.BR pthread_setschedparam (3).
