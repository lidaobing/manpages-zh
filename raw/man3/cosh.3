.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR cosh ()
function returns the hyperbolic cosine of
.IR x ,
which
is defined mathematically as:
.nf

    cosh(x) = (exp(x) + exp(\-x)) / 2
.fi
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the hyperbolic cosine of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is +0 or \-0, 1 is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity or negative infinity,
positive infinity is returned.

If the result overflows,
a range error occurs,
and the functions return
.RB + HUGE_VAL ,
.RB + HUGE_VALF ,
or
.RB + HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Range error: result overflow
.I errno
is set to
.BR ERANGE .
An overflow floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW )
is raised.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD.
.SH BUGS
In glibc version 2.3.4 and earlier,
an overflow floating-point
.RB ( FE_OVERFLOW  )
exception is not raised when an overflow occurs.
