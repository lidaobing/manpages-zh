The standard streams,
.IR stdin ,
.IR stdout ,
and
.I stderr
are also closed.
.SH RETURN VALUE
This function returns 0 if all files were successfully closed;
on error,
.B EOF
is returned.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR fcloseall ()
function does not lock the streams, so it is not thread-safe.
