.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR gcvt ()
function converts \fInumber\fP to a minimal length null-terminated
ASCII string and stores the result in \fIbuf\fP.
It produces \fIndigit\fP significant digits in either
.BR printf (3)
F format or E format.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR gcvt ()
function returns the address of the string pointed to
by \fIbuf\fP.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Marked as LEGACY in POSIX.1-2001.
POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of
.BR gcvt (),
recommending the use of
.BR sprintf (3)
instead (though
.BR snprintf (3)
may be preferable).

.BR fcvt (3),
