.TH BYTEORDER 3  2009-01-15 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
htonl, htons, ntohl, ntohs \- convert values between host and network
byte order
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <arpa/inet.h>
.sp
.BI "uint32_t htonl(uint32_t " hostlong );
.sp
.BI "uint16_t htons(uint16_t " hostshort );
.sp
.BI "uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t " netlong );
.sp
.BI "uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t " netshort );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR htonl ()
function converts the unsigned integer
.I hostlong
from host byte order to network byte order.
.PP
The
.BR htons ()
function converts the unsigned short integer
.I hostshort
from host byte order to network byte order.
.PP
The
.BR ntohl ()
function converts the unsigned integer
.I netlong
from network byte order to host byte order.
.PP
The
.BR ntohs ()
function converts the unsigned short integer
.I netshort
from network byte order to host byte order.
.PP
On the i386 the host byte order is Least Significant Byte first,
whereas the network byte order, as used on the Internet, is Most
Significant Byte first.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001.

Some systems require the inclusion of
.I <netinet/in.h>
instead of
.IR <arpa/inet.h> .
