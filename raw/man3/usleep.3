.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR usleep ()
function suspends execution of the calling thread for
(at least) \fIusec\fP microseconds.
The sleep may be lengthened slightly
by any system activity or by the time spent processing the call or by the
granularity of system timers.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR usleep ()
function returns 0 on success.
On error, \-1 is returned, with
.I errno
set to indicate the cause of the error.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINTR
Interrupted by a signal; see
.BR signal (7).
.TP
.B EINVAL
\fIusec\fP is not smaller than 1000000.
(On systems where that is considered an error.)
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
POSIX.1-2001 declares this function obsolete; use
.BR nanosleep (2)
instead.
POSIX.1-2008 removes the specification of
.BR usleep ().

On the original BSD implementation,
and in glibc before version 2.2.2, the return type of this function is
.IR void .
The POSIX version returns
.IR int ,
and this is also the prototype used since glibc 2.2.2.

Only the
.B EINVAL
error return is documented by SUSv2 and POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
The type
.I useconds_t
is an unsigned integer type capable of holding integers
in the range [0,1000000].
Programs will be more portable
if they never mention this type explicitly.
Use
.in +4n

.sp
#include <unistd.h>
