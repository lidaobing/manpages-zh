.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR seekdir ()
function sets the location in the directory stream
from which the next
.BR readdir (2)
call will start.
The
.I loc
argument should be a value returned by a previous call to
.BR telldir (3).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR seekdir ()
function returns no value.
.SH ATTRIBUTES
.SS Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
The
.BR seekdir ()
function is thread-safe.
.SH CONFORMING TO
4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
In glibc up to version 2.1.1, the type of the
.I loc
argument was
.IR off_t .
POSIX.1-2001 specifies
.IR long ,
and this is the type used since glibc 2.1.2.
See
.BR telldir (3)
for information on why you should be careful in making any
assumptions about the value in this argument.
