.SH NAME
fseeko, ftello \- seek to or report file position
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int fseeko(FILE *" stream ", off_t " offset ", int " whence );
.sp
.BI "off_t ftello(FILE *" stream );
.BI
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fseeko ()
and
.BR ftello ()
functions are identical to
.BR fseek (3)
and
.BR ftell (3)
(see
.BR fseek (3)),
respectively, except that the
.I offset
argument of
.BR fseeko ()
and the return value of
.BR ftello ()
is of type
.I off_t
instead of
.IR long .
.LP
On many architectures both
.IR off_t
and
.I long
are 32-bit types,
but compilation with
.RS
.nf

#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
.fi
.RE
.PP
will turn
.I off_t
into a 64-bit type.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On successful completion,
.BR fseeko ()
returns 0, while
.BR ftello ()
returns the current offset.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
See the ERRORS in
.BR fseek (3).
.SH CONFORMING TO
SUSv2, POSIX.1-2001.
.SH NOTES
These functions are found on System V-like systems.
They are not present in libc4, libc5, glibc 2.0
but are available since glibc 2.1.
