.SH DESCRIPTION
.I log1p(x)
returns a value equivalent to
.nf

    log (1 + \fIx\fP)

.fi
It is computed in a way
that is accurate even if the value of
.I x
is near zero.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the natural logarithm of
.IR "(1\ +\ x)" .

If
.I x
is a NaN,
a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

If
.I x
is \-1, a pole error occurs,
and the functions return
.RB - HUGE_VAL ,
.RB - HUGE_VALF ,
or
.RB - HUGE_VALL ,
respectively.

If
.I x
is less than \-1 (including negative infinity),
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN (not a number) is returned.
.\" POSIX.1 specifies a possible range error if x is subnormal
.\" glibc 2.8 doesn't do this
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP is less than \-1
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.TP
Pole error: \fIx\fP is \-1
.\" .I errno
.\" is set to
.\" .BR ERANGE .
A divide-by-zero floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_DIVBYZERO )
is raised.
.PP
These functions do not set
.IR errno .
.\" FIXME . Is it intentional that these functions do not set errno?
.\" log(), log2(), log10() do set errno
.\" Bug raised: http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6792
