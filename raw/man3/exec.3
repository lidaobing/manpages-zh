.BR execvpe ():
_GNU_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR exec ()
family of functions replaces the current process image with a new process
image.
The functions described in this manual page are front-ends for
.BR execve (2).
(See the manual page for
.BR execve (2)
for further details about the replacement of the current process image.)
.PP
The initial argument for these functions is the name of a file that is
to be executed.
.PP
The
.I "const char\ *arg"
and subsequent ellipses in the
.BR execl (),
.BR execlp (),
and
.BR execle ()
functions can be thought of as
.IR arg0 ,
.IR arg1 ,
\&...,
.IR argn .
Together they describe a list of one or more pointers to null-terminated
strings that represent the argument list available to the executed program.
The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename associated
with the file being executed.
The list of arguments
.I must
be terminated by a NULL
pointer, and, since these are variadic functions, this pointer must be cast
.IR "(char\ *) NULL" .
.PP
The
.BR execv (),
.BR execvp (),
and
.BR execvpe ()
functions provide an array of pointers to null-terminated strings that
represent the argument list available to the new program.
The first argument, by convention, should point to the filename
associated with the file being executed.
The array of pointers
.I must
be terminated by a NULL pointer.
.PP
The
.BR execle ()
and
.BR execvpe ()
functions allow the caller to specify the environment of the
executed program via the argument
.IR envp .
The
.I envp
argument is an array of pointers to null-terminated strings and
.I must
be terminated by a NULL pointer.
The other functions take the environment for the new process
image from the external variable
.I environ
in the calling process.
.SS Special semantics for execlp() and execvp()
.PP
The
.BR execlp (),
.BR execvp (),
and
.BR execvpe ()
functions duplicate the actions of the shell in
searching for an executable file
if the specified filename does not contain a slash (/) character.
The file is sought in the colon-separated list of directory pathnames
specified in the
.B PATH
environment variable.
If this variable isn't defined, the path list defaults to
the current directory followed by the list of directories returned by
.IR confstr(_CS_PATH) .
(This
.BR confstr (3)
call typically returns the value "/bin:/usr/bin".)

If the specified filename includes a slash character, then
.B PATH
is ignored, and the file at the specified pathname is executed.

In addition, certain errors are treated specially.

If permission is denied for a file (the attempted
.BR execve (2)
failed with the error
.BR EACCES ),
these functions will continue searching the rest of the search path.
If no other file is found, however,
they will return with
.I errno
set to
.BR EACCES .

If the header of a file isn't recognized (the attempted
.BR execve (2)
failed with the error
.BR ENOEXEC ),
these functions will execute the shell
.RI ( /bin/sh )
with the path of the file as its first argument.
(If this attempt fails, no further searching is done.)
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR exec ()
functions return only if an error has occurred.
The return value is \-1, and
.I errno
is set to indicate the error.
.SH ERRORS
All of these functions may fail and set
.I errno
for any of the errors specified for
.BR execve (2).
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR execvpe ()
function first appeared in glibc 2.11.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

The
.BR execvpe ()
function is a GNU extension.
.SH NOTES
On some other systems, the default path (used when the environment
does not contain the variable \fBPATH\fR) has the current working
directory listed after
.I /bin
and
.IR /usr/bin ,
as an anti-Trojan-horse measure.
Linux uses here the
traditional "current directory first" default path.
.PP
The behavior of
.BR execlp ()
and
.BR execvp ()
when errors occur while attempting to execute the file is historic
practice, but has not traditionally been documented and is not specified by
the POSIX standard.
BSD (and possibly other systems) do an automatic
sleep and retry if
.B ETXTBSY
is encountered.
Linux treats it as a hard
error and returns immediately.
.PP
Traditionally, the functions
.BR execlp ()
and
.BR execvp ()
ignored all errors except for the ones described above and
.B ENOMEM
and
.BR E2BIG ,
upon which they returned.
They now return if any error other than the ones
described above occurs.
