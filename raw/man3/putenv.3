.SH NAME
putenv \- change or add an environment variable

.BR putenv ():
_SVID_SOURCE || _XOPEN_SOURCE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR putenv ()
function adds or changes the value of environment
variables.
The argument \fIstring\fP is of the form \fIname\fP=\fIvalue\fP.
If \fIname\fP does not already exist in the environment, then
\fIstring\fP is added to the environment.
If \fIname\fP does exist,
then the value of \fIname\fP in the environment is changed to
\fIvalue\fP.
The string pointed to by \fIstring\fP becomes part of the environment,
so altering the string changes the environment.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The
.BR putenv ()
function returns zero on success,
or nonzero if an error occurs.
In the event of an error,
.I errno
is set to indicate the cause.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient space to allocate new environment.
.SH CONFORMING TO
SVr4, POSIX.1-2001, 4.3BSD.
.SH NOTES
The
.BR putenv ()
function is not required to be reentrant, and the
one in libc4, libc5 and glibc 2.0 is not, but the glibc 2.1 version is.
.LP
Description for libc4, libc5, glibc:
If the argument \fIstring\fP is of the form \fIname\fP,
and does not contain an \(aq=\(aq character, then the variable \fIname\fP
is removed from the environment.
If
.BR putenv ()
has to allocate a new array \fIenviron\fP,
and the previous array was also allocated by
.BR putenv (),
then it will be freed.
In no case will the old storage associated
to the environment variable itself be freed.
.LP
The libc4 and libc5 and glibc 2.1.2 versions conform to SUSv2:
the pointer \fIstring\fP given to
.BR putenv ()
is used.
In particular, this string becomes part of the environment;
changing it later will change the environment.
(Thus, it is an error is to call
.BR putenv ()
with an automatic variable
as the argument, then return from the calling function while \fIstring\fP
is still part of the environment.)
However, glibc 2.0-2.1.1 differs: a copy of the string is used.
On the one hand this causes a memory leak, and on the other hand
it violates SUSv2.
This has been fixed in glibc 2.1.2.
.LP
The 4.4BSD version, like glibc 2.0, uses a copy.
.LP
SUSv2 removes the \fIconst\fP from the prototype, and so does glibc 2.1.3.
