.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR sqrt ()
function returns the nonnegative square root of
.IR x .
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, these functions return the square root of
.IR x .

If
.I x
is a NaN, a NaN is returned.

If
.I x
is +0 (\-0), +0 (\-0) is returned.

If
.I x
is positive infinity, positive infinity is returned.

If
.I x
is less than \-0,
a domain error occurs,
and a NaN is returned.
.SH ERRORS
See
.BR math_error (7)
for information on how to determine whether an error has occurred
when calling these functions.
.PP
The following errors can occur:
.TP
Domain error: \fIx\fP less than \-0
.I errno
is set to
.BR EDOM .
An invalid floating-point exception
.RB ( FE_INVALID )
is raised.
.SH CONFORMING TO
C99, POSIX.1-2001.
The variant returning
.I double
also conforms to
SVr4, 4.3BSD, C89.
