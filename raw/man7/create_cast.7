.SH NAME
CREATE CAST \- define a new cast

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
CREATE CAST (\fIsourcetype\fR AS \fItargettype\fR)
    WITH FUNCTION \fIfuncname\fR (\fIargtype\fR)
    [ AS ASSIGNMENT | AS IMPLICIT ]

CREATE CAST (\fIsourcetype\fR AS \fItargettype\fR)
    WITHOUT FUNCTION
    [ AS ASSIGNMENT | AS IMPLICIT ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCREATE CAST\fR defines a new cast. A cast
specifies how to perform a conversion between
two data types. For example,
.sp
.nf
SELECT CAST(42 AS text);
.sp
.fi
converts the integer constant 42 to type \fBtext\fR by
invoking a previously specified function, in this case
text(int4). (If no suitable cast has been defined, the
conversion fails.)
.PP
Two types may be \fIbinary compatible\fR, which
means that they can be converted into one another ``for
free'' without invoking any function. This requires that
corresponding values use the same internal representation. For
instance, the types \fBtext\fR and \fBvarchar\fR are
binary compatible.
.PP
By default, a cast can be invoked only by an explicit cast request,
that is an explicit CAST(\fIx\fR AS
\fItypename\fR),
\fIx\fR::\fItypename\fR, or
\fItypename\fR(\fIx\fR) construct.
.PP
If the cast is marked AS ASSIGNMENT then it can be invoked
implicitly when assigning a value to a column of the target data type.
For example, supposing that foo.f1 is a column of
type \fBtext\fR, then
.sp
.nf
INSERT INTO foo (f1) VALUES (42);
.sp
.fi
will be allowed if the cast from type \fBinteger\fR to type
\fBtext\fR is marked AS ASSIGNMENT, otherwise
not.
(We generally use the term \fIassignment
cast\fR to describe this kind of cast.)
.PP
If the cast is marked AS IMPLICIT then it can be invoked
implicitly in any context, whether assignment or internally in an
expression. For example, since || takes \fBtext\fR
operands,
.sp
.nf
SELECT 'The time is ' || now();
.sp
.fi
will be allowed only if the cast from type \fBtimestamp\fR to
\fBtext\fR is marked AS IMPLICIT. Otherwise it
will be necessary to write the cast explicitly, for example
.sp
.nf
SELECT 'The time is ' || CAST(now() AS text);
.sp
.fi
(We generally use the term \fIimplicit
cast\fR to describe this kind of cast.)
.PP
It is wise to be conservative about marking casts as implicit. An
overabundance of implicit casting paths can cause
PostgreSQL to choose surprising
interpretations of commands, or to be unable to resolve commands at
all because there are multiple possible interpretations. A good
rule of thumb is to make a cast implicitly invokable only for
information-preserving transformations between types in the same
general type category. For example, the cast from \fBint2\fR to
\fBint4\fR can reasonably be implicit, but the cast from
\fBfloat8\fR to \fBint4\fR should probably be
assignment-only. Cross-type-category casts, such as \fBtext\fR
to \fBint4\fR, are best made explicit-only.
.PP
To be able to create a cast, you must own the source or the target
data type. To create a binary-compatible cast, you must be superuser.
(This restriction is made because an erroneous binary-compatible cast
conversion can easily crash the server.)
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIsourcetype\fB\fR
The name of the source data type of the cast.
.TP
\fB\fItargettype\fB\fR
The name of the target data type of the cast.
.TP
\fB\fIfuncname\fB(\fIargtype\fB)\fR
The function used to perform the cast. The function name may
be schema-qualified. If it is not, the function will be looked
up in the path. The argument type must be identical to the
source type, the result data type must match the target type of
the cast.
.TP
\fBWITHOUT FUNCTION\fR
Indicates that the source type and the target type are binary
compatible, so no function is required to perform the cast.
.TP
\fBAS ASSIGNMENT\fR
Indicates that the cast may be invoked implicitly in assignment
contexts.
.TP
\fBAS IMPLICIT\fR
Indicates that the cast may be invoked implicitly in any context.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Use \fBDROP CAST\fR to remove user-defined casts.
.PP
Remember that if you want to be able to convert types both ways you
need to declare casts both ways explicitly.
.PP
Prior to PostgreSQL 7.3, every function that had
the same name as a data type, returned that data type, and took one
argument of a different type was automatically a cast function.
This convention has been abandoned in face of the introduction of
schemas and to be able to represent binary compatible casts in the
system catalogs. (The built-in cast functions still follow this naming
scheme, but they have to be shown as casts in the system catalog pg_cast
now.)
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To create a cast from type \fBtext\fR to type
\fBint4\fR using the function int4(text):
.sp
.nf
CREATE CAST (text AS int4) WITH FUNCTION int4(text);
.sp
.fi
(This cast is already predefined in the system.)
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The \fBCREATE CAST\fR command conforms to SQL99,
except that SQL99 does not make provisions for binary-compatible
types. AS IMPLICIT is a PostgreSQL
extension, too.
