The name of the user to remove.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
PostgreSQL includes a program dropuser [\fBdropuser\fR(1)] that has the
same functionality as this command (in fact, it calls this command)
but can be run from the command shell.
.PP
To drop a user who owns a database, first drop the database or change
its ownership.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
To drop a user account:
.sp
.nf
DROP USER jonathan;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The \fBDROP USER\fR statement is a
PostgreSQL extension. The SQL standard
leaves the definition of users to the implementation.

ALTER USER [\fBalter_user\fR(7)], CREATE USER [\fBcreate_user\fR(l)]
