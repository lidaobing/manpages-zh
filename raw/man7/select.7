.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBSELECT\fR retrieves rows from one or more tables.
The general processing of \fBSELECT\fR is as follows:
.IP 1. 
All elements in the FROM list are computed.
(Each element in the FROM list is a real or
virtual table.) If more than one element is specified in the
FROM list, they are cross-joined together.
(See FROM Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 2. 
If the WHERE clause is specified, all rows
that do not satisfy the condition are eliminated from the
output. (See WHERE Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 3. 
If the GROUP BY clause is specified, the
output is divided into groups of rows that match on one or more
values. If the HAVING clause is present, it
eliminates groups that do not satisfy the given condition. (See
GROUP BY Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] and
HAVING Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 4. 
Using the operators UNION,
INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, the
output of more than one \fBSELECT\fR statement can
be combined to form a single result set. The
UNION operator returns all rows that are in
one or both of the result sets. The
INTERSECT operator returns all rows that are
strictly in both result sets. The EXCEPT
operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but
not in the second. In all three cases, duplicate rows are
eliminated unless ALL is specified. (See
UNION Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)], INTERSECT Clause [\fBselect\fR(l)], and
EXCEPT Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 5. 
The actual output rows are computed the
\fBSELECT\fR output expressions for each selected
row. (See
SELECT List [\fBselect\fR(7)]
below.)
.IP 6. 
If the ORDER BY clause is specified, the
returned rows are sorted in the specified order. If
ORDER BY is not given, the rows are returned
in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce. (See
ORDER BY Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 7. 
If the LIMIT or OFFSET
clause is specified, the \fBSELECT\fR statement
only returns a subset of the result rows. (See LIMIT Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 8. 
DISTINCT eliminates duplicate rows from the
result. DISTINCT ON eliminates rows that
match on all the specified expressions. ALL
(the default) will return all candidate rows, including
duplicates. (See DISTINCT Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.IP 9. 
The FOR UPDATE clause causes the
\fBSELECT\fR statement to lock the selected rows
against concurrent updates. (See FOR UPDATE Clause [\fBselect\fR(7)] below.)
.PP
.PP
You must have SELECT privilege on a table to
read its values. The use of FOR UPDATE requires
UPDATE privilege as well.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.SS "FROM CLAUSE"
.PP
The FROM clause specifies one or more source
tables for the \fBSELECT\fR. If multiple sources are
specified, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all
the sources. But usually qualification conditions
are added to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the
Cartesian product.
.PP
FROM-clause elements can contain:
.TP
\fB\fItable_name\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or
view. If ONLY is specified, only that table is
scanned. If ONLY is not specified, the table and
all its descendant tables (if any) are scanned. *
can be appended to the table name to indicate that descendant
tables are to be scanned, but in the current version, this is
the default behavior. (In releases before 7.1,
ONLY was the default behavior.) The default
behavior can be modified by changing the
sql_interitance configuration option.
.TP
\fB\fIalias\fB\fR
A substitute name for the FROM item containing the
alias. An alias is used for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity
for self-joins (where the same table is scanned multiple
times). When an alias is provided, it completely hides the
actual name of the table or function; for example given
FROM foo AS f, the remainder of the
\fBSELECT\fR must refer to this FROM
item as f not foo. If an alias is
written, a column alias list can also be written to provide
substitute names for one or more columns of the table.
.TP
\fB\fIselect\fB\fR
A sub-\fBSELECT\fR can appear in the
FROM clause. This acts as though its
output were created as a temporary table for the duration of
this single \fBSELECT\fR command. Note that the
sub-\fBSELECT\fR must be surrounded by
parentheses, and an alias \fBmust\fR be
provided for it.
.TP
\fB\fIfunction_name\fB\fR
Function calls can appear in the FROM
clause. (This is especially useful for functions that return
result sets, but any function can be used.) This acts as
though its output were created as a temporary table for the
duration of this single \fBSELECT\fR command. An
alias may also be used. If an alias is written, a column alias
list can also be written to provide substitute names for one
or more attributes of the function's composite return type. If
the function has been defined as returning the \fBrecord\fR
data type, then an alias or the key word AS must
be present, followed by a column definition list in the form
( \fIcolumn_name\fR \fIdata_type\fR [, ... ]
). The column definition list must match the actual
number and types of columns returned by the function.
.TP

CROSS JOIN
.RE
.PP
For the INNER and OUTER join types, a
join condition must be specified, namely exactly one of
NATURAL, ON \fIjoin_condition\fR, or
USING (\fIjoin_column\fR [, ...]).
See below for the meaning. For CROSS JOIN,
none of these clauses may appear.

A JOIN clause, combines two
FROM items. (Use parentheses if necessary to
determine the order of nesting.)

CROSS JOIN and INNER JOIN
produce a simple Cartesian product, the same as you get from
listing the two items at the top level of FROM.
CROSS JOIN is equivalent to INNER JOIN ON
(true), that is, no rows are removed by qualification.
These join types are just a notational convenience, since they
do nothing you couldn't do with plain FROM and
WHERE.

LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows in the qualified
Cartesian product (i.e., all combined rows that pass its join
condition), plus one copy of each row in the left-hand table
for which there was no right-hand row that passed the join
condition. This left-hand row is extended to the full width
of the joined table by inserting null values for the
right-hand columns. Note that only the JOIN
clauses own condition is considered while deciding which rows
have matches. Outer conditions are applied afterwards.

Conversely, RIGHT OUTER JOIN returns all the
joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row
(extended with nulls on the left). This is just a notational
convenience, since you could convert it to a LEFT
OUTER JOIN by switching the left and right inputs.

FULL OUTER JOIN returns all the joined rows, plus
one row for each unmatched left-hand row (extended with nulls
on the right), plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row
(extended with nulls on the left).
.TP
\fBON \fIjoin_condition\fB\fR
\fIjoin_condition\fR is
an expression resulting in a value of type
\fBboolean\fR (similar to a WHERE
clause) that specifies which rows in a join are considered to
match.
.TP
\fBUSING (\fIjoin_column\fB [, ...])\fR
A clause of the form USING ( a, b, ... ) is
shorthand for ON left_table.a = right_table.a AND
left_table.b = right_table.b .... Also,
USING implies that only one of each pair of
equivalent columns will be included in the join output, not
both.
.TP
\fBNATURAL\fR
NATURAL is shorthand for a
USING list that mentions all columns in the two
tables that have the same names.
.PP
.SS "WHERE CLAUSE"
.PP
The optional WHERE clause has the general form
.sp
.nf
WHERE \fIcondition\fR
.sp
.fi
where \fIcondition\fR is
any expression that evaluates to a result of type
\fBboolean\fR. Any row that does not satisfy this
condition will be eliminated from the output. A row satisfies the
condition if it returns true when the actual row values are
substituted for any variable references.
.SS "GROUP BY CLAUSE"
.PP
The optional GROUP BY clause has the general form
.sp
.nf
GROUP BY \fIexpression\fR [, ...]
.sp
.fi
.PP
GROUP BY will condense into a single row all
selected rows that share the same values for the grouped
expressions. \fIexpression\fR can be an input column
name, or the name or ordinal number of an output column
(\fBSELECT\fR list), or it can be an arbitrary
expression formed from input-column values. In case of ambiguity,
a GROUP BY name will be interpreted as an
input-column name rather than an output column name.
.PP
Aggregate functions, if any are used, are computed across all rows
making up each group, producing a separate value for each group
(whereas without GROUP BY, an aggregate
produces a single value computed across all the selected rows).
When GROUP BY is present, it is not valid for
the \fBSELECT\fR list expressions to refer to
ungrouped columns except within aggregate functions, since there
would be more than one possible value to return for an ungrouped
column.
.SS "HAVING CLAUSE"
.PP
The optional HAVING clause has the general form
.sp
.nf
HAVING \fIcondition\fR
.sp
.fi
where \fIcondition\fR is
the same as specified for the WHERE clause.
.PP
HAVING eliminates group rows that do not
satisfy the condition. HAVING is different
from WHERE: WHERE filters
individual rows before the application of GROUP
BY, while HAVING filters group rows
created by GROUP BY. Each column referenced in
\fIcondition\fR must
unambiguously reference a grouping column, unless the reference
appears within an aggregate function.
.SS "UNION CLAUSE"
.PP
The UNION clause has this general form:
.sp
.nf
\fIselect_statement\fR UNION [ ALL ] \fIselect_statement\fR
.sp
.fi
\fIselect_statement\fR is
any \fBSELECT\fR statement without an ORDER
BY, LIMIT, or FOR UPDATE clause.
(ORDER BY and LIMIT can be attached to a
subexpression if it is enclosed in parentheses. Without
parentheses, these clauses will be taken to apply to the result of
the UNION, not to its right-hand input
expression.)
.PP
The UNION operator computes the set union of
the rows returned by the involved \fBSELECT\fR
statements. A row is in the set union of two result sets if it
appears in at least one of the result sets. The two
\fBSELECT\fR statements that represent the direct
operands of the UNION must produce the same
number of columns, and corresponding columns must be of compatible
data types.
.PP
The result of UNION does not contain any duplicate
rows unless the ALL option is specified.
ALL prevents elimination of duplicates.
.PP
Multiple UNION operators in the same
\fBSELECT\fR statement are evaluated left to right,
unless otherwise indicated by parentheses.
.PP
Currently, FOR UPDATE may not be specified either for
a UNION result or for the inputs of UNION.
.SS "INTERSECT CLAUSE"
.PP
The INTERSECT clause has this general form:
.sp
.nf
\fIselect_statement\fR INTERSECT [ ALL ] \fIselect_statement\fR
.sp
.fi
\fIselect_statement\fR is
any \fBSELECT\fR statement without an ORDER
BY, LIMIT, or FOR UPDATE clause.
.PP
The INTERSECT operator computes the set
intersection of the rows returned by the involved
\fBSELECT\fR statements. A row is in the
intersection of two result sets if it appears in both result sets.
.PP
The result of INTERSECT does not contain any
duplicate rows unless the ALL option is specified.
With ALL, a row that has m duplicates in the left
table and n duplicates in the right table will appear min(m,n)
times in the result set.
.PP
Multiple INTERSECT operators in the same
\fBSELECT\fR statement are evaluated left to right,
unless parentheses dictate otherwise.
INTERSECT binds more tightly than
UNION. That is, A UNION B INTERSECT
C will be read as A UNION (B INTERSECT
C).
.SS "EXCEPT CLAUSE"
.PP
The EXCEPT clause has this general form:
.sp
.nf
\fIselect_statement\fR EXCEPT [ ALL ] \fIselect_statement\fR
.sp
.fi
\fIselect_statement\fR is
any \fBSELECT\fR statement without an ORDER
BY, LIMIT, or FOR UPDATE clause.
.PP
The EXCEPT operator computes the set of rows
that are in the result of the left \fBSELECT\fR
statement but not in the result of the right one.
.PP
The result of EXCEPT does not contain any
duplicate rows unless the ALL option is specified.
With ALL, a row that has m duplicates in the left
table and n duplicates in the right table will appear max(m-n,0)
times in the result set.
.PP
Multiple EXCEPT operators in the same
\fBSELECT\fR statement are evaluated left to right,
unless parentheses dictate otherwise. EXCEPT binds at
the same level as UNION.
.SS "SELECT LIST"
.PP
The \fBSELECT\fR list (between the key words
SELECT and FROM) specifies expressions
that form the output rows of the \fBSELECT\fR
statement. The expressions can (and usually do) refer to columns
computed in the FROM clause. Using the clause
AS \fIoutput_name\fR, another
name can be specified for an output column. This name is
primarily used to label the column for display. It can also be
used to refer to the column's value in ORDER BY and
GROUP BY clauses, but not in the WHERE or
HAVING clauses; there you must write out the
expression instead.
.PP
Instead of an expression, * can be written in
the output list as a shorthand for all the columns of the selected
rows. Also, one can write \fItable_name\fR.* as a
shorthand for the columns coming from just that table.
.SS "ORDER BY CLAUSE"
.PP
The optional ORDER BY clause has this general form:
.sp
.nf
ORDER BY \fIexpression\fR [ ASC | DESC | USING \fIoperator\fR ] [, ...]
.sp
.fi
\fIexpression\fR can be the
name or ordinal number of an output column
(\fBSELECT\fR list), or it can be an arbitrary
expression formed from input-column values.
.PP
The ORDER BY clause causes the result rows to
be sorted according to the specified expressions. If two rows are
equal according to the leftmost expression, the are compared
according to the next expression and so on. If they are equal
according to all specified expressions, they are returned in
random order.
.PP
The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position
of the result column. This feature makes it possible to define an
ordering on the basis of a column that does not have a unique
name. This is never absolutely necessary because it is always
possible to assign a name to a result column using the
AS clause.
.PP
It is also possible to use arbitrary expressions in the
ORDER BY clause, including columns that do not
appear in the \fBSELECT\fR result list. Thus the
following statement is valid:
.sp
.nf
SELECT name FROM distributors ORDER BY code;
.sp
.fi
A limitation of this feature is that an ORDER BY
clause applying to the result of a UNION,
INTERSECT, or EXCEPT clause may only
specify an output column name or number, not an expression.
.PP
If an ORDER BY expression is a simple name that
matches both a result column name and an input column name,
ORDER BY will interpret it as the result column name.
This is the opposite of the choice that GROUP BY will
make in the same situation. This inconsistency is made to be
compatible with the SQL standard.
.PP
Optionally one may add the key word ASC (ascending) or
DESC (descending) after each expression in the
ORDER BY clause. If not specified, ASC is
assumed by default. Alternatively, a specific ordering operator
name may be specified in the USING clause.
ASC is usually equivalent to USING < and
DESC is usually equivalent to USING >.
(But the creator of a user-defined data type can define exactly what the
default sort ordering is, and it might correspond to operators with other
names.)
.PP
The null value sorts higher than any other value. In other words,
with ascending sort order, null values sort at the end, and with
descending sort order, null values sort at the beginning.
.PP
Character-string data is sorted according to the locale-specific
collation order that was established when the database cluster
was initialized.
.SS "LIMIT CLAUSE"
.PP
The LIMIT clause consists of two independent
clauses:
.sp
.nf
LIMIT { \fIcount\fR | ALL }
OFFSET \fIstart\fR
.sp
.fi
\fIcount\fR specifies the
maximum number of rows to return, and \fIstart\fR specifies the number of rows
to skip before starting to return rows.
.PP
When using LIMIT, it is a good idea to use an
ORDER BY clause that constrains the result rows into a
unique order. Otherwise you will get an unpredictable subset of
the query's rows---you may be asking for the tenth through
twentieth rows, but tenth through twentieth in what ordering? You
don't know what ordering unless you specify ORDER BY.
.PP
The query planner takes LIMIT into account when
generating a query plan, so you are very likely to get different
plans (yielding different row orders) depending on what you use
for LIMIT and OFFSET. Thus, using
different LIMIT/OFFSET values to select
different subsets of a query result \fBwill give
inconsistent results\fR unless you enforce a predictable
result ordering with ORDER BY. This is not a bug; it
is an inherent consequence of the fact that SQL does not promise
to deliver the results of a query in any particular order unless
ORDER BY is used to constrain the order.
.SS "DISTINCT CLAUSE"
.PP
If DISTINCT is specified, all duplicate rows are
removed from the result set (one row is kept from each group of
duplicates). ALL specifies the opposite: all rows are
kept; that is the default.
.PP
DISTINCT ON ( \fIexpression\fR [, ...] )
keeps only the first row of each set of rows where the given
expressions evaluate to equal. The DISTINCT ON
expressions are interpreted using the same rules as for
ORDER BY (see above). Note that the ``first
row'' of each set is unpredictable unless ORDER
BY is used to ensure that the desired row appears first. For
example,
.sp
.nf
SELECT DISTINCT ON (location) location, time, report
    FROM weather_reports
    ORDER BY location, time DESC;
.sp
.fi
retrieves the most recent weather report for each location. But
if we had not used ORDER BY to force descending order
of time values for each location, we'd have gotten a report from
an unpredictable time for each location.
.SS "FOR UPDATE CLAUSE"
.PP
The FOR UPDATE clause has this form:
.sp
.nf
FOR UPDATE [ OF \fItable_name\fR [, ...] ]
.sp
.fi
.PP
FOR UPDATE causes the rows retrieved by the
\fBSELECT\fR statement to be locked as though for
update. This prevents them from being modified or deleted by
other transactions until the current transaction ends. That is,
other transactions that attempt \fBUPDATE\fR,
\fBDELETE\fR, or \fBSELECT FOR UPDATE\fR
of these rows will be blocked until the current transaction ends.
Also, if an \fBUPDATE\fR, \fBDELETE\fR,
or \fBSELECT FOR UPDATE\fR from another transaction
has already locked a selected row or rows, \fBSELECT FOR
UPDATE\fR will wait for the other transaction to complete,
and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the
row was deleted). For further discussion see the chapter called ``Concurrency Control'' in the documentation.
.PP
If specific tables are named in FOR UPDATE,
then only rows coming from those tables are locked; any other
tables used in the \fBSELECT\fR are simply read as
usual.
.PP
FOR UPDATE cannot be used in contexts where
returned rows can't be clearly identified with individual table
rows; for example it can't be used with aggregation.
.PP
FOR UPDATE may appear before
LIMIT for compatibility with
PostgreSQL versions before 7.3. It
effectively executes after LIMIT, however, and
so that is the recommended place to write it.

.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
Of course, the \fBSELECT\fR statement is compatible
with the SQL standard. But there are some extensions and some
missing features.
.SS "OMITTED FROM CLAUSES"
.PP
PostgreSQL allows one to omit the
FROM clause. It has a straightforward use to
compute the results of simple expressions:
.sp
.nf
SELECT 2+2;

 ?column?
----------
        4
.sp
.fi
Some other SQL databases cannot do this except
by introducing a dummy one-row table from which to do the
\fBSELECT\fR.
.PP
A less obvious use is to abbreviate a normal
\fBSELECT\fR from tables:
.sp
.nf
SELECT distributors.* WHERE distributors.name = 'Westward';

 did |   name
-----+----------
 108 | Westward
.sp
.fi
This works because an implicit FROM item is
added for each table that is referenced in other parts of the
\fBSELECT\fR statement but not mentioned in
FROM.
.PP
While this is a convenient shorthand, it's easy to misuse. For
example, the command
.sp
.nf
SELECT distributors.* FROM distributors d;
.sp
.fi
is probably a mistake; most likely the user meant
.sp
.nf
SELECT d.* FROM distributors d;
.sp
.fi
rather than the unconstrained join
.sp
.nf
SELECT distributors.* FROM distributors d, distributors distributors;
.sp
.fi
that he will actually get. To help detect this sort of mistake,
PostgreSQL will warn if the
implicit-FROM feature is used in a
\fBSELECT\fR statement that also contains an explicit
FROM clause. Also, it is possible to disable
the implicit-FROM feature by setting the
ADD_MISSING_FROM parameter to false.
.SS "THE AS KEY WORD"
.PP
In the SQL standard, the optional key word AS is just
noise and can be omitted without affecting the meaning. The
PostgreSQL parser requires this key
word when renaming output columns because the type extensibility
features lead to parsing ambiguities without it.
AS is optional in FROM
items, however.
.SS "NAMESPACE AVAILABLE TO GROUP BY AND ORDER BY"
.PP
In the SQL92 standard, an ORDER BY clause may
only use result column names or numbers, while a GROUP
BY clause may only use expressions based on input column
names. PostgreSQL extends each of
these clauses to allow the other choice as well (but it uses the
standard's interpretation if there is ambiguity).
PostgreSQL also allows both clauses to
specify arbitrary expressions. Note that names appearing in an
expression will always be taken as input-column names, not as
result-column names.
.PP
SQL99 uses a slightly different definition which is not upward compatible
with SQL92. In most cases, however, PostgreSQL
will interpret an ORDER BY or GROUP
BY expression the same way SQL99 does.
.SS "NONSTANDARD CLAUSES"
.PP
The clauses DISTINCT ON,
LIMIT, and OFFSET are not
defined in the SQL standard.
