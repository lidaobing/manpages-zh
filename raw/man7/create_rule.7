CREATE RULE \- define a new rewrite rule

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] RULE \fIname\fR AS ON \fIevent\fR
    TO \fItable\fR [ WHERE \fIcondition\fR ]
    DO [ INSTEAD ] { NOTHING | \fIcommand\fR | ( \fIcommand\fR ; \fIcommand\fR ... ) }
.sp
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCREATE RULE\fR defines a new rule applying to a specified
table or view.
\fBCREATE OR REPLACE RULE\fR will either create a
new rule, or replace an existing rule of the same name for the same
table.
.PP
The PostgreSQL rule system allows one to
define an alternate action to be performed on insertions, updates,
or deletions in database tables. Roughly speaking, a rule causes
additional commands to be executed when a given command on a given
table is executed. Alternatively, a rule can replace a given
command by another, or cause a command not to be executed at all.
Rules are used to implement table views as well. It is important
to realize that a rule is really a command transformation
mechanism, or command macro. The transformation happens before the
execution of the commands starts. If you actually want an
operation that fires independently for each physical row, you
probably want to use a trigger, not a rule. More information about
the rules system is in the chapter called ``The Rule System'' in the documentation.
.PP
Presently, ON SELECT rules must be unconditional
INSTEAD rules and must have actions that consist
of a single \fBSELECT\fR command. Thus, an
ON SELECT rule effectively turns the table into
a view, whose visible contents are the rows returned by the rule's
\fBSELECT\fR command rather than whatever had been
stored in the table (if anything). It is considered better style
to write a \fBCREATE VIEW\fR command than to create a
real table and define an ON SELECT rule for it.
.PP
You can create the illusion of an updatable view by defining
ON INSERT, ON UPDATE, and
ON DELETE rules (or any subset of those that's
sufficient for your purposes) to replace update actions on the view
with appropriate updates on other tables.
.PP
There is a catch if you try to use conditional rules for view
updates: there \fBmust\fR be an unconditional
INSTEAD rule for each action you wish to allow
on the view. If the rule is conditional, or is not
INSTEAD, then the system will still reject
attempts to perform the update action, because it thinks it might
end up trying to perform the action on the dummy table of the view
in some cases. If you want to handle all the useful cases in
conditional rules, you can; just add an unconditional DO
INSTEAD NOTHING rule to ensure that the system
understands it will never be called on to update the dummy table.
Then make the conditional rules not INSTEAD; in
the cases where they are applied, they add to the default
INSTEAD NOTHING action.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fB\fIname\fB\fR
The name of a rule to create. This must be distinct from the
name of any other rule for the same table. Multiple rules on
the same table and same event type are applied in alphabetical
name order.
.TP
\fB\fIevent\fB\fR
The even is one of SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE, or
DELETE.
.TP
\fB\fItable\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table or view the
rule applies to.
.TP
\fB\fIcondition\fB\fR
Any SQL conditional expression (returning \fBboolean\fR).
The condition expression may not refer to any tables except
NEW and OLD, and may not
contain aggregate functions.
.TP
\fB\fIcommand\fB\fR
The command or commands that make up the rule action. Valid
commands are SELECT,
INSERT, UPDATE,
DELETE, or NOTIFY.
.PP
Within \fIcondition\fR and
\fIcommand\fR, the special
table names NEW and OLD may
be used to refer to values in the referenced table.
NEW is valid in ON INSERT and
ON UPDATE rules to refer to the new row being
inserted or updated. OLD is valid in
ON UPDATE and ON DELETE rules
to refer to the existing row being updated or deleted.
.PP
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
You must have the privilege RULE on a table to
be allowed to define a rule on it.
.PP
It is very important to take care to avoid circular rules. For
example, though each of the following two rule definitions are
accepted by PostgreSQL, the
\fBSELECT\fR command would cause
PostgreSQL to report an error because
the query cycled too many times:
.sp
.nf
CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS
    ON SELECT TO t1
    DO INSTEAD 
	SELECT * FROM t2;

CREATE RULE "_RETURN" AS
    ON SELECT TO t2
    DO INSTEAD 
	SELECT * FROM t1;

SELECT * FROM t1;
.sp
.fi
.PP
Presently, if a rule action contains a \fBNOTIFY\fR
command, the \fBNOTIFY\fR command will be executed
unconditionally, that is, the \fBNOTIFY\fR will be
issued even if there are not any rows that the rule should apply
to. For example, in
.sp
.nf
CREATE RULE notify_me AS ON UPDATE TO mytable DO NOTIFY mytable;

UPDATE mytable SET name = 'foo' WHERE id = 42;
.sp
.fi
one \fBNOTIFY\fR event will be sent during the
\fBUPDATE\fR, whether or not there are any rows with
id = 42. This is an implementation restriction
that may be fixed in future releases.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
\fBCREATE RULE\fR is a
PostgreSQL language extension, as is the
entire rules system.
