respects, the behavior of this command is identical to the BEGIN [\fBbegin\fR(7)] command.
.SH "PARAMETERS"

See under SET TRANSACTION [\fBset_transaction\fR(7)] about the meaning of the
parameters.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
This command conforms to the SQL standard; but see also the
compatibility section of SET TRANSACTION [\fBset_transaction\fR(7)].
.SH "SEE ALSO"
BEGIN [\fBbegin\fR(7)], COMMIT [\fBcommit\fR(l)], ROLLBACK [\fBrollback\fR(l)], SET TRANSACTION [\fBset_transaction\fR(l)]
