.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBCOMMENT\fR stores a comment about a database object.
Comments can be
easily retrieved with the \fBpsql\fR commands
\fB\\dd\fR, \fB\\d+\fR, and \fB\\l+\fR.
Other user interfaces to retrieve comments can be built atop
the same built-in functions that \fBpsql\fR uses, namely
\fBobj_description\fR and \fBcol_description\fR.
.PP
To modify a comment, issue a new \fBCOMMENT\fR command for the
same object. Only one comment string is stored for each object.
To remove a comment, write NULL in place of the text
string.
Comments are automatically dropped when the object is dropped.

The name of the object to be be commented. Names of tables,
aggregates, domains, functions, indexes, operators, sequences,
types, and views may be schema-qualified.
.TP
\fB\fItext\fB\fR
The new comment.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
There is presently no security mechanism for comments: any user
connected to a database can see all the comments for objects in
that database (although only superusers can change comments for
objects that they don't own). Therefore, don't put
security-critical information in comments.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Attach a comment to the table mytable:
.sp
.nf
COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS 'This is my table.';
.sp
.fi
Remove it again:
.sp
.nf
COMMENT ON TABLE mytable IS NULL;
.sp
.fi
.PP
Some more examples:
.sp
.nf
COMMENT ON AGGREGATE my_aggregate (double precision) IS 'Computes sample variance';
COMMENT ON COLUMN my_table.my_column IS 'Employee ID number';
COMMENT ON DATABASE my_database IS 'Development Database';
COMMENT ON DOMAIN my_domain IS 'Email Address Domain';
COMMENT ON FUNCTION my_function (timestamp) IS 'Returns Roman Numeral';
COMMENT ON INDEX my_index IS 'Enforces uniqueness on employee ID';
COMMENT ON OPERATOR ^ (text, text) IS 'Performs intersection of two texts';
COMMENT ON OPERATOR ^ (NONE, text) IS 'This is a prefix operator on text';
COMMENT ON RULE my_rule ON my_table IS 'Logs updates of employee records';
COMMENT ON SCHEMA my_schema IS 'Departmental data';
COMMENT ON SEQUENCE my_sequence IS 'Used to generate primary keys';
COMMENT ON TABLE my_schema.my_table IS 'Employee Information';
COMMENT ON TRIGGER my_trigger ON my_table IS 'Used for RI';
COMMENT ON TYPE complex IS 'Complex number data type';
COMMENT ON VIEW my_view IS 'View of departmental costs';
