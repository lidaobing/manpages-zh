.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBREVOKE\fR command revokes previously granted
privileges from one or more users or groups of users. The key word
PUBLIC refers to the implicitly defined group of
all users.
.PP
See the description of the GRANT [\fBgrant\fR(7)] command for
the meaning of the privilege types.
.PP
Note that any particular user will have the sum
of privileges granted directly to him, privileges granted to any group he
is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
PUBLIC. Thus, for example, revoking SELECT privilege
from PUBLIC does not necessarily mean that all users
have lost SELECT privilege on the object: those who have it granted
directly or via a group will still have it.
.PP
If GRANT OPTION FOR is specified, only the grant
option for the privilege is revoked, not the privilege itself.
.PP
If a user holds a privilege with grant option and has granted it to
other users then the privileges held by those other users are
called dependent privileges. If the privilege or the grant option
held by the first user is being revoked and dependent privileges
exist, those dependent privileges are also revoked if
CASCADE is specified, else the revoke action
will fail. This recursive revocation only affects privileges that
were granted through a chain of users that is traceable to the user
that is the subject of this REVOKE command.
Thus, the affected users may effectively keep the privilege if it
was also granted through other users.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Use \fBpsql\fR(1)'s \fB\\z\fR command to
display the privileges granted on existing objects. See also GRANT [\fBgrant\fR(7)] for information about the format.
.PP
A user can only revoke privileges that were granted directly by
that user. If, for example, user A has granted a privilege with
grant option to user B, and user B has in turned granted it to user
C, then user A cannot revoke the privilege directly from C.
Instead, user A could revoke the grant option from user B and use
the CASCADE option so that the privilege is
automatically revoked from user C.
.PP
If a superuser chooses to issue a \fBGRANT\fR or \fBREVOKE\fR
command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the
owner of the affected object. Since all privileges ultimately come
from the object owner (possibly indirectly via chains of grant options),
it is possible for a superuser to revoke all privileges, but this may
require use of CASCADE as stated above.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Revoke insert privilege for the public on table
films:
.sp
.nf
REVOKE INSERT ON films FROM PUBLIC;
.sp
.fi
.PP
Revoke all privileges from user manuel on view kinds:
.sp
.nf
  
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON kinds FROM manuel;
.sp
.fi
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
The compatibility notes of the GRANT [\fBgrant\fR(7)] command
apply analogously to \fBREVOKE\fR. The syntax summary is:
.sp
.nf
REVOKE [ GRANT OPTION FOR ] \fIprivileges\fR
    ON \fIobject\fR [ ( \fIcolumn\fR [, ...] ) ]
    FROM { PUBLIC | \fIusername\fR [, ...] }
    { RESTRICT | CASCADE }
.sp
.fi
One of RESTRICT or CASCADE
is required according to the standard, but PostgreSQL
assumes RESTRICT by default.
