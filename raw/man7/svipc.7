.SH NAME
svipc \- System V interprocess communication mechanisms
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/msg.h>
.B #include <sys/sem.h>
.B #include <sys/shm.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page refers to the Linux implementation of the System V
interprocess communication (IPC) mechanisms:
message queues, semaphore sets, and shared memory segments.
In the following, the word
.I resource
means an instantiation of one among such mechanisms.
.SS Resource access permissions
For each resource, the system uses a common structure of type
.I "struct ipc_perm"
to store information needed in determining permissions to perform an
IPC operation.
The
.I ipc_perm
structure includes the following members:
.in +4n
.nf

struct ipc_perm {
    uid_t          cuid;   /* creator user ID */
    gid_t          cgid;   /* creator group ID */
    uid_t          uid;    /* owner user ID */
    gid_t          gid;    /* owner group ID */
    unsigned short mode;   /* r/w permissions */
};
.fi
.in
.PP
The
.I mode
member of the
.I ipc_perm
structure defines, with its lower 9 bits, the access permissions to the
resource for a process executing an IPC system call.
The permissions are interpreted as follows:
.sp
.nf
    0400    Read by user.
    0200    Write by user.
.sp .5
    0040    Read by group.
    0020    Write by group.
.sp .5
    0004    Read by others.
    0002    Write by others.
.fi
.PP
Bits 0100, 0010, and 0001 (the execute bits) are unused by the system.
Furthermore,
"write"
effectively means
"alter"
for a semaphore set.
.PP
The same system header file also defines the following symbolic
constants:
.TP 14
.B IPC_CREAT
Create entry if key doesn't exist.
.TP
.B IPC_EXCL
Fail if key exists.
.TP
.B IPC_NOWAIT
Error if request must wait.
.TP
.B IPC_PRIVATE
Private key.
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
Remove resource.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
Set resource options.
.TP
.B IPC_STAT
Get resource options.
.PP
Note that
.B IPC_PRIVATE
is a
.I key_t
type, while all the other symbolic constants are flag fields and can
be OR'ed into an
.I int
type variable.
.SS Message queues
A message queue is uniquely identified by a positive integer
.RI "(its " msqid )
and has an associated data structure of type
.IR "struct msqid_ds" ,
defined in
.IR <sys/msg.h> ,
containing the following members:
.in +4n
.nf

struct msqid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm msg_perm;
    msgqnum_t       msg_qnum;    /* no of messages on queue */
    msglen_t        msg_qbytes;  /* bytes max on a queue */
    pid_t           msg_lspid;   /* PID of last msgsnd(2) call */
    pid_t           msg_lrpid;   /* PID of last msgrcv(2) call */
    time_t          msg_stime;   /* last msgsnd(2) time */
    time_t          msg_rtime;   /* last msgrcv(2) time */
    time_t          msg_ctime;   /* last change time */
};
.fi
.in
.TP 11

queue.

Maximum number of bytes of message text allowed on the message
queue.
.TP

.BR msgrcv (2)
system call.

.BR msgsnd (2)
system call.
.TP
.I msg_rtime
Time of the last
.BR msgrcv (2)
system call.
.TP
.I msg_ctime
Time of the last
system call that changed a member of the
.I msqid_ds
structure.
.SS Semaphore sets
A semaphore set is uniquely identified by a positive integer
.RI "(its " semid )
and has an associated data structure of type
.IR "struct semid_ds" ,
defined in
.IR <sys/sem.h> ,
containing the following members:
.in +4n
.nf

struct semid_ds {
    struct ipc_perm sem_perm;
    time_t          sem_otime;   /* last operation time */
    time_t          sem_ctime;   /* last change time */
    unsigned long   sem_nsems;   /* count of sems in set */
};

.TP
.I sem_nsems

ranging from
.B 0
to
.IR sem_nsems\-1 .
.PP
A semaphore is a data structure of type
.I "struct sem"
containing the following members:
.in +4n
.nf

struct sem {
    int semval;  /* semaphore value */
    int sempid;  /* PID for last operation */
.\"    unsigned short semncnt; /* nr awaiting semval to increase */
.\"    unsigned short semzcnt; /* nr awaiting semval = 0 */
};
