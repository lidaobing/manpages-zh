.TH ARP 7 2008-11-25 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
arp \- Linux ARP kernel module.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This kernel protocol module implements the Address Resolution
Protocol defined in RFC\ 826.
It is used to convert between Layer2 hardware addresses
and IPv4 protocol addresses on directly connected networks.
The user normally doesn't interact directly with this module except to
configure it;
instead it provides a service for other protocols in the kernel.

A user process can receive ARP packets by using
.BR packet (7)
sockets.
There is also a mechanism for managing the ARP cache
in user-space by using
.BR netlink (7)
sockets.
The ARP table can also be controlled via
.BR ioctl (2)
on any
.B AF_INET
socket.

The ARP module maintains a cache of mappings between hardware addresses
and protocol addresses.
The cache has a limited size so old and less
frequently used entries are garbage-collected.
Entries which are marked
as permanent are never deleted by the garbage-collector.
The cache can
be directly manipulated by the use of ioctls and its behavior can be
tuned by the
.I /proc
interfaces described below.

When there is no positive feedback for an existing mapping after some
time (see the
.I /proc
interfaces below), a neighbor cache entry is considered stale.
Positive feedback can be gotten from a higher layer; for example from
a successful TCP ACK.
Other protocols can signal forward progress
using the
.B MSG_CONFIRM
flag to
.BR sendmsg (2).
When there is no forward progress, ARP tries to reprobe.
It first tries to ask a local arp daemon
.B app_solicit
times for an updated MAC address.
If that fails and an old MAC address is known, a unicast probe is sent
.B ucast_solicit
times.
If that fails too, it will broadcast a new ARP
request to the network.
Requests are sent only when there is data queued
for sending.

Linux will automatically add a nonpermanent proxy arp entry when it
receives a request for an address it forwards to and proxy arp is
enabled on the receiving interface.
When there is a reject route for the target, no proxy arp entry is added.
.SS Ioctls
Three ioctls are available on all
.B AF_INET
sockets.
They take a pointer to a
.I struct arpreq
as their argument.

.in +4n
.nf
struct arpreq {
    struct sockaddr arp_pa;      /* protocol address */
    struct sockaddr arp_ha;      /* hardware address */
    int             arp_flags;   /* flags */
    struct sockaddr arp_netmask; /* netmask of protocol address */
    char            arp_dev[16];
};
.fi
.in

.BR SIOCSARP ", " SIOCDARP " and " SIOCGARP
respectively set, delete and get an ARP mapping.
Setting and deleting ARP maps are privileged operations and may
be performed only by a process with the
.B CAP_NET_ADMIN
capability or an effective UID of 0.

.I arp_pa
must be an
.B AF_INET
address and
.I arp_ha
must have the same type as the device which is specified in
.IR arp_dev .
.I arp_dev
is a zero-terminated string which names a device.

.PP
If the
.B ATF_NETMASK
flag is set, then
.I arp_netmask
should be valid.
Linux 2.2 does not support proxy network ARP entries, so this
should be set to 0xffffffff, or 0 to remove an existing proxy arp entry.
.B ATF_USETRAILERS
is obsolete and should not be used.
.SS /proc interfaces
ARP supports a range of
.I /proc
interfaces to configure parameters on a global or per-interface basis.
The interfaces can be accessed by reading or writing the
.I /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/*/*
files.
Each interface in the system has its own directory in
.IR /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/ .
The setting in the "default" directory is used for all newly created
devices.
Unless otherwise specified, time-related interfaces are specified
in seconds.

from higher level protocols.

.SH VERSIONS
The
.I struct arpreq
changed in Linux 2.0 to include the
.I arp_dev
member and the ioctl numbers changed at the same time.
Support for the old ioctls was dropped in Linux 2.2.

Support for proxy arp entries for networks (netmask not equal 0xffffffff)
was dropped in Linux 2.2.
It is replaced by automatic proxy arp setup by
the kernel for all reachable hosts on other interfaces (when
forwarding and proxy arp is enabled for the interface).

The
.I neigh/*
interfaces did not exist before Linux 2.2.
.SH BUGS
Some timer settings are specified in jiffies, which is architecture-
and kernel version-dependent; see
.BR time (7).

There is no way to signal positive feedback from user space.
This means connection-oriented protocols implemented in user space
will generate excessive ARP traffic, because ndisc will regularly
reprobe the MAC address.
The same problem applies for some kernel protocols (e.g., NFS over UDP).

This man page mashes IPv4 specific and shared between IPv4 and IPv6
functionality together.
