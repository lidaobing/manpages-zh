VACUUM \- garbage-collect and optionally analyze a database

.SH SYNOPSIS

VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] [ \fItable\fR ]
VACUUM [ FULL ] [ FREEZE ] [ VERBOSE ] ANALYZE [ \fItable\fR [ (\fIcolumn\fR [, ...] ) ] ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBVACUUM\fR reclaims storage occupied by deleted tuples.
In normal PostgreSQL operation, tuples that
are deleted or obsoleted by an update are not physically removed from
their table; they remain present until a \fBVACUUM\fR is
done. Therefore it's necessary to do \fBVACUUM\fR
periodically, especially on frequently-updated tables.
.PP
With no parameter, \fBVACUUM\fR processes every table in the
current database. With a parameter, \fBVACUUM\fR processes
only that table.
.PP
\fBVACUUM ANALYZE\fR performs a \fBVACUUM\fR
and then an \fBANALYZE\fR for each selected table. This
is a handy combination form for routine maintenance scripts. See
ANALYZE [\fBanalyze\fR(7)]
for more details about its processing.
.PP
Plain \fBVACUUM\fR (without FULL) simply reclaims
space and makes it
available for re-use. This form of the command can operate in parallel
with normal reading and writing of the table, as an exclusive lock
is not obtained. \fBVACUUM
FULL\fR does more extensive processing, including moving of tuples
across blocks to try to compact the table to the minimum number of disk
blocks. This form is much slower and requires an exclusive lock on each
table while it is being processed.
.PP
\fBFREEZE\fR is a special-purpose option that
causes tuples to be marked ``frozen'' as soon as possible,
rather than waiting until they are quite old. If this is done when there
are no other open transactions in the same database, then it is guaranteed
that all tuples in the database are ``frozen'' and will not be
subject to transaction ID wraparound problems, no matter how long the
database is left unvacuumed.
\fBFREEZE\fR is not recommended for routine use. Its only
intended usage is in connection with preparation of user-defined template
databases, or other databases that are completely read-only and will not
receive routine maintenance \fBVACUUM\fR operations.
See the chapter called ``Routine Database Maintenance'' in the documentation for details.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.TP
\fBFULL\fR
Selects ``full'' vacuum, which may reclaim more
space, but takes much longer and exclusively locks the table.
.TP
\fBFREEZE\fR
Selects aggressive ``freezing'' of tuples.
.TP
\fBVERBOSE\fR
Prints a detailed vacuum activity report for each table.
.TP
\fBANALYZE\fR
Updates statistics used by the planner to determine the most
efficient way to execute a query.
.TP
\fB\fItable\fB\fR
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a specific table to
vacuum. Defaults to all tables in the current database.
.TP
\fB\fIcolumn\fB\fR
The name of a specific column to analyze. Defaults to all columns.
.SH "OUTPUTS"
.PP
When VERBOSE is specified, \fBVACUUM\fR emits
progress messages to indicate which table is currently being
processed. Various statistics about the tables are printed as well.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
We recommend that active production databases be
vacuumed frequently (at least nightly), in order to
remove expired rows. After adding or deleting a large number
of rows, it may be a good idea to issue a \fBVACUUM
ANALYZE\fR command for the affected table. This will update the
system catalogs with
the results of all recent changes, and allow the
PostgreSQL query planner to make better
choices in planning queries.
.PP
The \fBFULL\fR option is not recommended for routine use,
but may be useful in special cases. An example is when you have deleted
most of the rows in a table and would like the table to physically shrink
to occupy less disk space. \fBVACUUM FULL\fR will usually
shrink the table more than a plain \fBVACUUM\fR would.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The following is an example from running \fBVACUUM\fR on a
table in the regression database:
